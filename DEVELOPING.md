## Commit messages

Commit messages follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification that
allows them to be readable both by humans and machines easily.

The available types and scopes have been listed out in [.commitlintrc.json](.commitlintrc.json) and a plugin
called [Commitlint Conventional Commit](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14046-commitlint-conventional-commit) for
IntelliJ IDEA adds a nice UI and checks the usage of the proper types and scopes when committing.
