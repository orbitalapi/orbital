# Overview
Vyne's Schema Server operates as a central aggregator of multiple schema sources.

In this guide, we'll look at a couple of common ways to publish a schema to the schema server.
More detailed information is available in the <Link to="/reference/schema-server/schema-server">Schema Server Reference Guide</Link>.

## Find your schema-server config file
By default, the Schema Server is configured by a file called `repositories.conf` in the directory where you
launched the Schema Server from.

You may have overridden this when you launched the Schema Server, by specifying `--vyne.repositories.config-file=...`.

If you're running one of our demo tutorials, the config file is at `vyne/schema-server/schema-server.conf`, relative
to the docker-compose file you used.

Find and open the schema-server config file in your editor of choice.

## Polling a file based taxi project
File based projects are typically used when running Vyne locally in a development environment.
All of our guides use a file based project.

When using a file based taxi project, the schema server will watch the project for file system changes, and
automatically republish up to Vyne.

Modify the configuration file, adding the below section.

```hocon
file {
   paths=[
      "/path/to/project"
   ]
}
```

<Callout type='hint' title='Use the right path'>

   Ensure you add the path to the **directory** that contains the `taxi.conf` file you just created, but not the taxi.conf itself

   * Correct: `/path/to/directory`
   * Incorrect: `/path/to/directory/taxi.conf`

</Callout>

Save and close the config file, and restart the schema server.
The taxi project should now show in the Schema Explorer.

## Polling a git based taxi project

In a production environment, it's more common to use a git repository for your taxi project, rather than using your local file system.

Modify the configyuration file, adding the below section.

```hocon
git {
   checkoutRoot="/my/git/root"
   pollFrequency=PT30S
   repositories=[
      {
         branch=master
         name=my-git-project
         uri="https://github.com/something.git"
      }
   ]
}
```

Save and close the config file, and restart the schema server.
The taxi project should now show in the Schema Explorer.
