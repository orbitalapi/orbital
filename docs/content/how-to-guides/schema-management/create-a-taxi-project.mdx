## Overview
Taxi is an agnostic schema language, useful for describing all types of data structures.
Vyne supports multiple schema formats (such as OpenAPI, SQL DDL, Protobuf, Avro), but has first-class support for Taxi.

Taxi is ideal for creating the core glossary of terms & types that you'll use in your central taxonomy.

In this tutorial, we'll explore creating a new taxi project, which will contain the schemas we edit in the UI.

To get started, first [install Taxi](https://taxilang.org/intro/getting-started/).

Then, create a directory for your project, and create a new taxi project, following the prompts:

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
taxi init

$ taxi version 1.20
> Project group (eg., com.acme): com.demo
> Project name: Films
> Project version [0.1.0]:  (Just press enter here)
> Source directory [src/]: (Just press enter here)
```

The taxi project has been created.

You can edit taxi files with any text editor, but we recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

There's a dedicated VSCode plugin for Taxi, which you'll be prompted to install whenever you open a taxi project.
It provides as-you-type completion, code hints, and more.
