## Overview

Semantic Types describe the meaning of content in a field, rather than just how it's written out by computers.

| System Type | Semantic Type     |
|-------------|-------------------|
| String      | CustomerId        |
| String      | CustomerFirstName |
| Int         | HouseNumber       |
| Int         | CustomerAge       |

The column on the left - `System Type` - describes how a system might read or write a field.
The column on the right - `Semantic Type` - describes the actual meaning of the text in a business sense.
