## Overview

Vyne's Schema Server operates as a central aggregator of multiple schema sources.
The Schema Server is responsible for reading Taxi projects and distributing their schemas across the Vyne ecosystem.

![schema-server](./schema-server-polling.drawio.svg)

The server can support multiple projects, loaded in a variety of different ways:

### Push modes:
Applications can "push" their schemas to the schema server, as and when is appropriate.
For most applications, this is on startup, or when a new version is deployed.  However,
some teams choose to do this via a CI/CD pipeline.

Some examples include:

 * Applications pushing Taxi schemas directly on startup
 * Applications pushing annotated OpenAPI / Protobuf / Avro etc schemas on startup
 * Pushing schemas in a CI/CD workflow

### Pull modes
The schema server can "pull" schemas from a variety of different sources.

For example:

 * Reading projects from the local file system
 * Reading projects from remote git repositories
 * Polling Swagger / OpenAPI endpoints, converting their schemas to Taxi

## Publishing external schemas
Systems can directly publish their schemas to the schema server on demand.
This approach is favoured where possible, as it means the publishing system
controls when to push changes.

### Schema Keep-alive
When a system publishes it's schema, it must inform the schema server how long the schema
remains current for.    This is known as the keep-alive.  When a schema fails it's keep-alive
tests, then the schema server removes the schema from the current aggregated schema.

The mechanisms for defining a keep alive vary depending on how the schemas themselves are published.

### Publishing via HTTP

### Publishing via RSocket


## Schema server monitored projects
Rather than [systems pushing their schemas directly](#publishing-external-schemas) to the schema server, the schema server can be
configured to watch / poll different types of schemas.

Schemas can be pulled from multiple different formats and approaches.  The configuration for these
repositories is defined in a [HOCON](https://github.com/lightbend/config#examples-of-hocon) format file.

By default, the configuration file is called `repositories.conf`.  However, the location of the file can be changed by setting `--vyne.repositories.config-file=/path/to/repositories.conf`
on the command line, or through any of the supported configuration overriding mechanisms.

#### Configuration conventions
Durations are defined using [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations) formats.  For example:
 * 1 Day = `P1D`
 * 3 Seconds = `PT3S`


### File repositories
File repositories watch a path local to the server. Changes made locally are detected
and trigger a republication of the schema, optionally incrementing the patch version
of the project.

| Config parameter               | Description                                                                                                      | Default setting    |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `changeDetectionMethod`        | The method for detecting changes - `WATCH` or `POLL`                                                             | `WATCH`            |
| `incrementVersionOnChange`     | Determines if the patch version should be incremented when publishing detected changes                           | `false`            |
| `pollFrequency`                | The frequency for polling the local file system for changes, if running in `POLL` mode                           | `PT5S` (5 seconds) |
| `recompilationFrequencyMillis` | Specifies the frequency that changes are recompiled when using a `WATCH` changeDetectionMethod.                  | `PT1S` (1 second)  |
| `paths`                        | A list of paths containing taxi projects.  Must point to the root of the project (containing a `taxi.conf` file) | Empty              |

#### Example

```hocon
file {
   changeDetectionMethod=WATCH
   incrementVersionOnChange=false
   paths=[
      "/path/to/project"
   ]
   pollFrequency=PT5S
   recompilationFrequencyMillis=PT3S
}
```

### Allowing edits from Vyne to a repository
Many of Vyne's UI features allow edits to types and importing of schemas.

These updates are sent to the Schema server, which will persist the edits into a Taxi project.
Currently, only persisting edits into a file repository are supported, with Git repositories
coming soon.

To enable edits into a project, specify a path as the `apiEditorProjectPath`.
Note that this must be a path of a project already configured elsewhere in the project configuration.

The schema server only supports pushing edits to a single project at this time.

#### Example with editable path
```hocon
file {
   paths=[
      "/path/to/project"
   ]
   apiEditorProjectPath: "path/to/project"
}
```

### OpenApi projects
Vyne can be configured to poll an OpenAPI or Swagger definition.

These definitions can be optionally enriched with [Taxi extensions](https://docs.taxilang.org/generating-taxi-from-source/#swagger--openapi) to describe
the semantic types present in model definitions

#### Example

```hocon
openApi {
   pollFrequency=PT20S
   services=[
      {
         connectTimeout="PT0.5S"
         defaultNamespace="com.foo.bar"
         name=some-service
         readTimeout=PT2S
         uri="https://foo.com/swagger.json"
      }
   ]
}
```

### Git repositories
In production, rather than using a [local file system](#file-repositories), it's common
to use a git repository.  This allows the use of standard git workflows to promote
changes to 'production'.

The schema server will periodically poll a git repository and branch, and pull in
any changes as they're detected

#### Example
```hocon
git {
   checkoutRoot="/my/git/root"
   pollFrequency=PT30S
   repositories=[
      {
         branch=master
         name=my-git-project
         uri="https://github.com/something.git"
      }
   ]
}
```

## Kitchen sink configuration example

```hocon
file {
   changeDetectionMethod=WATCH
   incrementVersionOnChange=false
   paths=[
      "/path/to/project"
   ]
   pollFrequency=PT5S
   recompilationFrequencyMillis=PT3S
}
git {
   checkoutRoot="/my/git/root"
   pollFrequency=PT30S
   repositories=[
      {
         branch=master
         name=my-git-project
         uri="https://github.com/something.git"
      }
   ]
}
openApi {
   pollFrequency=PT20S
   services=[
      {
         connectTimeout="PT0.5S"
         defaultNamespace="com.foo.bar"
         name=some-service
         readTimeout=PT2S
         uri="https://foo.com/swagger.json"
      }
   ]
}

```
