## Overview

Pipelines are a way of streaming data continuously between source and destination, and using Vyne to transform data along the way.

<Callout title='In beta' type='warning'>

   Pipelines are a new addition to the Vyne stack.  We're making them available
   as an early preview release, but you may hit a few rough edges.

Pipelines work by reading content from a source, transforming using Vyne, then writing to a Sink.

Pipelines can be defined either in a [config file](#pipeline-config-spec), or using the UI.

## Starting Pipeline Engine
The pipeline engine ships as a separate docker image.

A typical docker-compose config looks as follows:

```yaml
version: "3.3"
services:
  ## Other services omitted
   schema-server:
      image: vyneco/schema-server:${VYNE_VERSION:-latest}
      depends_on:
         - eureka
      volumes:
         - ${SCHEMA_PATH:-.}:/var/lib/vyne/schema-server
      environment:
         OPTIONS: >-
            --server.port=80
            --vyne.pipelines.pipeline-path=/path/to/pipeline/configs
```

### Application config
The pipeline server can be configured with the following properties.

These are generally passed into the `environment.OPTIONS` block within a docker services item in
docker compose.

| Config Parameter               | Description                                                                                                                  |
