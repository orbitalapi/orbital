## Overview

The Schema Server is responsible for reading Taxi projects and distributing their schemas across the Vyne ecosystem.

The server can support multiple projects, loaded in a variety of different ways:

 * Reading projects from the local file system
 * Reading projects from remote git repositories
 * Polling Swagger / OpenAPI endpoints, converting their schemas to Taxi
