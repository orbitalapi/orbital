title: Data lineage
description: Capture and understand where data was sourced from

Vyne will fetch data from multiple sources in order to satisfy the query presented.

Given this dynamic capability, it's important to be able to understand where data came from.  This is where Vyne's Lineage view comes into play.

## Viewing Lineage
To explore the lineage for a result, click on any cell in the Query Results table.
An overlay is displayed, showing the full lineage of how the value was returned.

![lineage](lineage.png)

Lineage captures:

 * The value itself
 * Which service the value was returned from
 * The inputs used for that service
 * How those inputs were tracked
 * etc., right back to the original data that was provided in the query.

This is made available for every value with a result.
