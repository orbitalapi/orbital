## Start a local instance of Vyne
For this tutorial, we're going to deploy Vyne, as well as a few demo projects
that we'll use throughout this tutorial.

Everything you need is packaged up in a docker-compose file

```bash
mkdir vyne-demo-01
cd vyne-demo-01
wget <docker-compose-path>
docker-compose up
```

Wait about a minute, and Vyne should be available at [http://localhost:9092](http://localhost:9092).
