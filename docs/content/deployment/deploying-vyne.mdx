## Deploying using Docker-Compose
We publish a default docker-compose config at [https://start.vyne.co](https://start.vyne.co).

This is a reasonable start for deploying a single-node Vyne environment, with a seperate schema server.


## Deploying using Kubernetes
For now, Vyne requires Eureka for service discovery.

We're working on deploying Vyne natively on Kubernetes, without
additional service discovery, which will be released in 0.21.

If you're interested in working with us as an early tester, please
[reach out on slack](https://join.slack.com/t/vyne-dev/shared_invite/zt-697laanr-DHGXXak5slqsY9DqwrkzHg),
as we'd love to work with you.


## Networking between components
Vyne is packaged as a collection of container images, which
need to be able to communicate between each other.

The following table outlines the components and, the default network addresses and ports that are
expected to be exposed.

| Component & Image                                                    | Purpose                                   | Optional component | Network address              | Port(s)                         |

When running with work-sharing enabled, Vyne also requires ports exposed to enable multicasting.  See [Clustered Deployment](clustered-deployment) for more information

### Using Eureka
Vyne can be configured to work with Netflix / Spring Boot Eureka for client side
service discovery.

#### Enabling Eureka support
Eureka support is disabled by default, and can be enabled by setting the
`eureka.client.enabled=true` flag on startup.
