## Taxi version
The Taxi version has changed in this release, new version is 1.30.5.

## New Features

### String replace function

This release of Vyne brings support for the  String `replace` function, recently added to Taxi lang.

```taxi
replace(String, String, String)
Replaces the contents of the provided String, returning a new String
      Accepts three args:
       * String: The string to search
       * String: The string to search for
       * String: The string to use as a replacement
      ]]
```

Example usage

```taxi
model Actor {
    actorName : ActorName
    anotherName : String by replace(this.actorName, "TEXT_TO_REPLACE", "REPLACEMENT_TEXT")
}
```

### Column type change in Cask tables
`cask_message` now stores references to LOB data as `oid`.  This enables usage of the `vacuumlo` Postgres utility  ( see https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/vacuumlo.html ) to remove orphaned large object from cask postgres database.
