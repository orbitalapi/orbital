0.19.5 is a patch release, containing only the upgrade of H2 dependency to address <Link to="https://github.com/h2database/h2database/security/advisories/GHSA-h376-j262-vhq6">RCE in H2 Console Vulnerability</Link>.
While we do not believe Vyne is affected by the exploit, this release upgrades the dependency as advised by H2, and as a precautionary measure.


## Taxi version
No change in taxi version (still 1.30.5) - Same as in 0.19.4

## Security Fixes

* Vyne query server H2 runtime dependency version upgraded to 2.0.206.
