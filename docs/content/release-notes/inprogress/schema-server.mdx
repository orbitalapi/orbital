The Vyne Schema Server has been modified to support service multiple different types of sources.

It's now possible to run a single server that exposes
 * Multiple git repositories
 * Multiple local file sources
 * Multiple OpenAPI schemas (new)

## Automatically converting OpenAPI to Taxi
TODO

## Breaking configuration changes

 * File locations are now restricted to only serving taxi projects, and must point to the root directory of a taxi project (ie., point to the folder where a `taxi.conf` file exists).  Previously it was valid to serve any directory.
 * Configuration has moved - all schema server configuration is now under `vyne.schemaServer` (previously was `taxi`)

### OpenApi configuration example:

```yaml
vyne:
  schema-server:
    openApi:
      ## Durations are in ISO Duration format.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations
      poll-frequency: PT20S
      services:
      - name: Petshop
        uri: https://petshop.com/openapispec
        default-namespace: com.petshop
      - name: Task list
        uri: https://tasklist.com/openapispec
        default-namespace: com.tasklist
        connect-timeout: PT1S # optional, default PT0.5S - format https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations
        read-timeout: PT10S # optional, default PT2S
```
### File location example:
```yaml
vyne:
  schema-server:
    file:
      change-detection-method: WATCH # Optional. Valid values are POLL or WATCH.  Defaults to WATCH
      ## Durations are in ISO Duration format.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations
      poll-frequency: PT20S # Optional.  Defaults to 5 seconds.  Ignored if changeDetectionMethod is POLL
      # Specifies the frequency that changes are recompiled when using a WATCH changeDetectionMethod.
      # We use millis explicitly (rather than duration syntax) here to allow for shorter durations
      recompilation-frequency-millis: 3000
      increment-version-on-change: false # Optional.  Defaults to false.
      paths:
        - /foo/bar/project-a
        - /foo/bar/project-b
```

### Git repository example:

```yaml
vyne:
  schema-server:
    git:
      # The location of where to check out repositories to.  (Each repository is a subfolder from here)
      checkout-root: /foo/bar/
      poll-frequency: PT30S
      repositories:
        - name: my-repo
          uri: https://some-git-repo
          branch: master
          sshPrivateKeyPath: /some/key/path # Optional
          sshPassPhrase: foo # Optional.  Can be env variable using ${thisSyntax}

```
