This page contains details of releases in the 0.19.xx set of releases.

## 0.19.0

0.19 is a feature release, containing multiple new features, including some breaking changes.

#### Taxi version
The Taxi version has not changed in this release, and remains on 1.30.2.

### Breaking change - Pipeline Runner Changes
If using a bespoke Pipeline Runner application, you'll need to make the following changes:

Remove the following annotation from the Spring boot application class (i.e. the type annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`)

```kotlin
@EnableConfigurationProperties(VyneCacheConfiguration::class)
```

Add the following imports:

```kotlin
import io.vyne.spring.config.VyneSpringCacheConfiguration
import io.vyne.spring.config.VyneSpringHazelcastConfiguration
import io.vyne.spring.config.VyneSpringProjectionConfiguration
import io.vyne.spring.http.auth.HttpAuthConfig
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Import
```

and annotate the Spring boot application class with these additional statements:

```kotlin
@Import(HttpAuthConfig::class)
@EnableConfigurationProperties(VyneSpringCacheConfiguration::class, VyneSpringProjectionConfiguration::class, VyneSpringHazelcastConfiguration::class)
```

Update 'vyne' configuration block in your application.yaml with the new mandatory projection and hazelcast configuration blocks.
As an example, update:

```yaml
    vyne:
        schema:
            publicationMethod: EUREKA
        queryService:
            name: QUERY-SERVICE
        pipelinesOrchestratorService:
            name: PIPELINES-ORCHESTRATOR
        caskService:
            name: CASK
        queryServiceUrl: http://query-service
        graph:
            vyneGraphBuilderCache:
                baseSchemaCacheSize: 100
                graphWithFactTypesCacheSize: 100
                baseSchemaGraphCacheSize: 100
            vyneDiscoverGraphQuery:
                schemaGraphCacheSize: 5
                searchPathExclusionsCacheSize: 200000
```
as:

```yaml
    vyne:
       schema:
          publicationMethod: EUREKA
       queryService:
          name: QUERY-SERVICE
       pipelinesOrchestratorService:
          name: PIPELINES-ORCHESTRATOR
       caskService:
          name: CASK
       queryServiceUrl: http://query-service
       graph:
          vyneGraphBuilderCache:
             baseSchemaCacheSize: 100
             graphWithFactTypesCacheSize: 100
             baseSchemaGraphCacheSize: 100
          vyneDiscoverGraphQuery:
             schemaGraphCacheSize: 5
             searchPathExclusionsCacheSize: 200000
       projection:
          distributionMode: LOCAL # One of [LOCAL | HAZELCAST] LOCAL = projections are performed on the instance process the query, HAZELCAST = distribute projection work to eligible members
          distributionPacketSize: 100 # Number of TypedInstances in a distributed workload - only applicable where distributionMode = HAZELCAST
          distributionRemoteBias: 10 # Number of nodes in the hazelcast cluster before work is preferentially distributed to remote nodes
       hazelcast:
          enabled: false # Enable or disable starting a hazelcast cluster
          discovery: MULTICAST # One of aws/multicast/swarm
          memberTag: vyne-query-service # Member tags allow delegation of responsibilities
          eurekaUri: http://127.0.0.1:8761/eureka/
```

### Breaking change - Embedded Vyne

Applications using Vyne in embedded mode will need to make the following changes upon updating to `0.19.0`.

Remove the following annotation from the Spring boot 'application class' (i.e. the type annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`)

```kotlin
@EnableConfigurationProperties(VyneCacheConfiguration::class)
```


Add the following imports:

```kotlin
import io.vyne.spring.config.VyneSpringCacheConfiguration
import io.vyne.spring.config.VyneSpringHazelcastConfiguration
import io.vyne.spring.config.VyneSpringProjectionConfiguration
import io.vyne.spring.http.auth.HttpAuthConfig
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Import
```

and annotate the Spring boot application class with these additional statements:

```kotlin
@Import(HttpAuthConfig::class)
@EnableConfigurationProperties(VyneSpringCacheConfiguration::class, VyneSpringProjectionConfiguration::class, VyneSpringHazelcastConfiguration::class)
```

Update Vyne configuration block in your `application.yaml` with the new mandatory projection and hazelcast configuration blocks.
As an example, update:

```yaml
    vyne:
        schema:
            publicationMethod: EUREKA
        queryService:
            name: QUERY-SERVICE
        pipelinesOrchestratorService:
            name: PIPELINES-ORCHESTRATOR
        caskService:
            name: CASK
        queryServiceUrl: http://query-service
        graph:
            vyneGraphBuilderCache:
                baseSchemaCacheSize: 100
                graphWithFactTypesCacheSize: 100
                baseSchemaGraphCacheSize: 100
            vyneDiscoverGraphQuery:
                schemaGraphCacheSize: 5
                searchPathExclusionsCacheSize: 200000
```
as:

```yaml
vyne:
  queryServiceUrl: http://localhost
  schema:
    publicationMethod: EUREKA
  queryService:
    name: query-service
  graph:
    vyneGraphBuilderCache:
      baseSchemaCacheSize: 100
      graphWithFactTypesCacheSize: 100
      baseSchemaGraphCacheSize: 100
    vyneDiscoverGraphQuery:
      schemaGraphCacheSize: 5
      searchPathExclusionsCacheSize: 200000
  projection:
    distributionMode: LOCAL # One of [LOCAL | HAZELCAST] LOCAL = projections are performed on the instance process the query, HAZELCAST = distribute projection work to eligible members
    distributionPacketSize: 100 # Number of TypedInstances in a distributed workload - only applicable where distributionMode = HAZELCAST
    distributionRemoteBias: 10 # Number of nodes in the hazelcast cluster before work is preferentially distributed to remote nodes
  hazelcast:
    enabled: false # Enable or disable starting a hazelcast cluster
    discovery: MULTICAST # One of aws/multicast/swarm
    memberTag: vyne-query-service # Member tags allow delegation of responsibilities
    eurekaUri: http://127.0.0.1:8761/eureka/
```
### Package rename: File Schema Server Changed

file-schema-server renamed as schema-server and hence starting from version 0.19.0 the corresponding docker image name is vyneco/schema-server


### Feature: Cask message retention
Casks can now be configured to retain messages for a specified duration.  Messages which are older than this duration
are periodically purged.

See  <Link to="/casks/configuring-message-retention/">Configuring cask retention</Link> for more details

### Feature: Writing Cask messages to Kafka
Casks can now be configured to output messages to Kafka as they are ingested.  For casks with a `@PrimaryKey` annotation, messages contain both the old and the new states.  Otherwise, the full message is output.

Enabling this setting is per-cask, and comes with a performance overhead at ingestion time.

See <Link to="/casks/kafka-publication">Writing Cask Messages to kafka</Link> for more details.

### Feature: Authentication headers
Vyne can now be configured to include authentication headers when calling upstream services.

See <Link to="/querying-with-vyne/authentication-to-services">Authentication Vyne to other services</Link> for more details.

### Feature: Distributing projection work over a cluster
Vyne can now be deployed with a cluster of nodes, and configured to parallelize the projection work of projecting queries.

See <Link to="/deployment/clustered-deployment/">clustered deployments</Link> for details of how to deploy Vyne in this configuration.  This is only
supported for query server workloads, and not currently available for embedded clients.

### Feature: Support for continuous queries in Vyne
Vyne now supports continuous queries - ie., queries from data sources that provide infinite streams of data.

Any service can publish support for continuous queries, by exposing a `text/event-stream` endpoint, and defining
the return type as `Stream<T>` in the schema.

See <Link to="/querying-with-vyne/continuous-queries/">Continuous queries</Link> for more details.

### Feature: Continuous query support in Casks
Support for continuous queries has been added to Casks, and is enabled by default.

See <Link to="/casks/continuous-queries/">Continuous queries with Casks</Link> for more details.

## 0.19.1

0.19.1 is a minor feature release

#### Taxi version
The Taxi version has changed in this release, new version is 1.30.5.

### Feature: String replace function

This release of Vyne brings support for the  String `replace` function, recently added to Taxi lang.

```taxi
replace(String, String, String)
Replaces the contents of the provided String, returning a new String
      Accepts three args:
       * String: The string to search
       * String: The string to search for
       * String: The string to use as a replacement
      ]]
```

Example usage

```taxi
model Actor {
    actorName : ActorName
    anotherName : String by replace(this.actorName, "TEXT_TO_REPLACE", "REPLACEMENT_TEXT")
}
```

### Fix: Column type change in Cask tables
`cask_message` now stores references to LOB data as `oid`.  This enables usage of the `vacuumlo` Postgres utility  ( see https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/vacuumlo.html ) to remove orphaned large object from cask postgres database.


## 0.19.2

0.19.2 is a patch release, containing only one bug fix.

#### Taxi version
No change in taxi version (still 1.30.5) - Same as in 0.19.1

## Bug Fixes

* Vyne now can use the result of interim 'post' rest api responses correctly during enrichment. (Fixes HLP-80)

## 0.19.3


0.19.3 is a patch release, containing only one bug fix and updates to Vyne configuration settings for embedded vyne and applications publishing schemas.

#### Taxi version
No change in taxi version (still 1.30.5) - Same as in 0.19.2

### Bug Fixes

* Vyne now can explore additional enrichment paths when it re-evaluates a previously failed path during search process.

### Configuration Changes

When embedding vyne to existing JVM application, release 0.19.2 requires adding 'projection' and 'hazelcast' configuration sections into the application configuration:

```yaml
    vyne:
       schema:
          publicationMethod: EUREKA
       queryService:
          name: QUERY-SERVICE
       pipelinesOrchestratorService:
          name: PIPELINES-ORCHESTRATOR
       caskService:
          name: CASK
       queryServiceUrl: http://query-service
       graph:
          vyneGraphBuilderCache:
             baseSchemaCacheSize: 100
             graphWithFactTypesCacheSize: 100
             baseSchemaGraphCacheSize: 100
          vyneDiscoverGraphQuery:
             schemaGraphCacheSize: 5
             searchPathExclusionsCacheSize: 200000
       projection:
          distributionMode: LOCAL # One of [LOCAL | HAZELCAST] LOCAL = projections are performed on the instance process the query, HAZELCAST = distribute projection work to eligible members
          distributionPacketSize: 100 # Number of TypedInstances in a distributed workload - only applicable where distributionMode = HAZELCAST
          distributionRemoteBias: 10 # Number of nodes in the hazelcast cluster before work is preferentially distributed to remote nodes
       hazelcast:
          enabled: false # Enable or disable starting a hazelcast cluster
          discovery: MULTICAST # One of aws/multicast/swarm
          memberTag: vyne-query-service # Member tags allow delegation of responsibilities
          eurekaUri: http://127.0.0.1:8761/eureka/
```

Above is not required anymore and 'projection' and 'hazelcast' vyne configuration sections can be omitted:

```yaml
