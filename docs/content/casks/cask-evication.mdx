Cask data is retained in cask

Cask is not intended to be a long term store of data, but a temporary store of data to support querying and projecting from
temporary data.

## Retention period

By default, Cask retains data for 1000 days, after which the data is removed by an internal Cask process


## Modifying retention period

Once a Cask is created its retention period may be modified using the Cask API

Request

URL: /api/casks/my.TypeName/evictSchedule
HTTP Method: PUT
BODY:

{
"daysToRetain": 100
}

e.g.

```text
curl -XPUT -d'{"daysToRetain": 60}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://cask:8800/api/casks/my.TypeName/evictSchedule
```

## Manual eviction of Cask data

Cask data may also be manually evicted using the API

Request

URL: /api/casks/my.TypeName/evict
HTTP Method: POST
BODY:

{
"writtenBefore": "2021-08-26T12:05:25Z"
}

e.g.

```text
curl -XPOST -d'{"writtenBefore": "2021-08-26T12:05:25Z"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://cask:8800/api/casks/{typeName}/evict
