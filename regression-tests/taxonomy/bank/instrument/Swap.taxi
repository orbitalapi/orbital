ISO currency codes are the three-letter alphabetic codes that represent the various [currencies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/isocurrencycode.asp) used
throughout the world. When combined in pairs, they make up the symbols and [cross rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crossrate.asp) used in currency
trading.
Each of the country-specific three-letter alphabetic codes also have a corresponding three-digit numeric code. These codes are identified by the
