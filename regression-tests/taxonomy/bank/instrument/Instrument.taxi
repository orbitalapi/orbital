Specifies the ratio or multiply factor to convert from "nominal" units (e.g. contracts) to total units (e.g. shares) (e.g. 1.0, 100, 1000, etc).
Applicable For Fixed Income, Convertible Bonds, Derivatives, etc.  In general quantities for all classes should be expressed in the basic unit of the instrument,

When quantity is expressed in contracts, e.g. financing transactions and bond trade reporting, it hould contain the number of units in one contract
and can be omitted if the multiplier is the default amount for the instrument, i.e. 1,000 par of bonds, 1,000,000 par for financing transactions
