The Legal Entity Identifier is the International ISO standard 17442.
LEIs are 20 digit codes that enable consistent and accurate identification of all legal entities that are parties to financial transactions,
including non-financial institutions. They enable a legal party to a financial transaction to be identified precisely.
It links back to a data set of critical information about the transacting entity, which can also include information on the ultimate ownership of the entity.
