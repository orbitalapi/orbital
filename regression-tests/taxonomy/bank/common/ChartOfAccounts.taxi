Based on the Murex GDM set-up, the internal CDR (meaning “Centre De Responsabilité” = “Profit Center”)
set-up is normally linked to an entity which is based in a specified location (e.g. Europe, US, Asia, etc.).
So in Ngaio’s case, her Orchestrade trading books are linked to her trading desk
(which has a CDR aligned to Paris that rolls up into Europe as an entity).

Please do note that this logic in terms of where to book her trades will be built / housed
within the OT trade booking system, so we can either seek to replicate it or instead collect
this data directly from the booking system without having to recreate its logic.
