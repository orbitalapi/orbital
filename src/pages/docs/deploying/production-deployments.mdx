## Deploying using Docker Compose
A sample `docker-compose.yml` is maintained by the Orbital team and published at [start.orbitalhq.com](https://start.orbitalhq.com).

It contains reasonable defaults for getting a local environment running.  Note that by default, Orbital does not enable
authentication or role-based authorization, and you'll need to enable these.

## Networking between components
Orbital is packaged as a collection of container images, which need to be able to communicate between each other.

The addresses used are configured in a file, which be default is loaded from  `config/services.conf`.

The location of the config file can be set by passing `--vyne.services.config-file` in the command line when starting Orbital.

| Config setting              | Default value          |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| `vyne.services.config-file` | `config/services.conf` |


If the config file doesn't exist, then a default file with reasonable defaults is written on startup.

An example of the config file is shown below:

```hocon
services {
    analytics-server {
        url="http://vyne-analytics-server"
    }
    cask-server {
        url="http://cask"
    }
    pipeline-runner {
        url="http://vyne-pipeline-runner"
    }
    query-server {
        url="http://vyne"
    }
    schema-server {
      url="http://vyne-schema-server"
      rsocket-port=7655
    }
}
```

The following table outlines the components and, the default network addresses and ports that are
expected to be exposed.  If deploying in a network like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes, it is expected
that services are available on the configured addresses.

Note:  If using [Eureka](#service-discovery-with-eureka), these settings have no effect.

<Callout title='See also' type='note'>

   When Orbital is configured to distribute work across a cluster, ports must also be exposed to enable multicasting. See [Distributing work across a cluster](./distributing-work-on-a-cluster) for more information.

### Service discovery with Eureka
Orbital can be configured to work with [Eureka](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka) for client side
service discovery.

Eureka support is disabled by default, and can be enabled by setting the
`eureka.client.enabled=true` flag on startup.  The full set of supported flags is shown below.


| Parameter                         | Purpose                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `eureka.client.enabled`           | Enables / disables Eureka.  Disabled by default                                         |
| `eureka.uri`                      | **Required**.  The http address of the Eureka server                                    |
| `eureka.instance.preferIpAddress` | Configures Eureka to prefer IP Address over DNS name registration.  Defaults to `false` |


<Callout title='Important' type='warning'>

   If using Eureka, you should apply these settings across all components in the Orbital stack.
