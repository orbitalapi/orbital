title: Enabling role based authorization

   In order to use role based authentication, you must have configured authorization
   with an OpenID Connect provider.

</Callout>

Orbital uses role based authorization to control which users can perform which tasks.

## First time usage
The first user to log into Orbital through OpenID is automatically assigned the Admin role,
allowing them to perform any action across the platform.

At this point, all required config files are also generated (if not already present),
and populated with reasonable defaults.


## Roles

Roles are used to grant [authorities](#authorities) to users - which allow
users to perform different actions on the Orbital platform.

The roles themselves are configurable.  Orbital ships with a set of reasonable
default roles - but you may choose to modify these, or build your own.

Roles are configured in a config file, typically found at `config/roles.conf`.

If the file is not present on startup, a new file is created the first time a user logs in.

```hocon
// Determines the role assigned to users by default when they first log in.
defaultUserRoleMappings {
  roles = [ "Viewer" ]
}

// Determines the role assigned to API users the first time they access the platform.
defaultApiClientRoleMappings {
  roles = [ "QueryRunner" ]
}

// Defines roles, and assigns them authorities.
// Users who are granted these roles will be authorised to perform
// the related activities
grantedAuthorityMappings {
   Admin {
      grantedAuthorities = [   "RunQuery",
                               "CancelQuery"
      ]
   }

   Viewer {
      grantedAuthorities = [ "BrowseCatalog" ]
   }
}
```

### List of default roles
The following roles are shipped by default:

| Role            | Granted Authorities |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Admin           | Everything          |
| Viewer          | BrowseCatalog       |
| QueryRunner     | RunQuery            |
| PlatformManager | CancelQuery, <br /> ViewQueryHistory <br /> ViewHistoricQueryResults <br /> BrowseSchema <br /> EditSchema <br /> ViewCaskDefinitions <br /> EditCaskDefinitions <br /> ViewPipelines <br /> EditPipelines <br /> ViewAuthenticationTokens <br /> EditAuthenticationTokens <br /> ViewConnections <br /> EditConnections |

## Assigning users to roles

Users are mapped to roles in a config file.  By default, this file is located at `config/user-role-mappings.conf`.

A sample of this file is shown:

```
userRoleMappings {
    jimmy {
        roles=[
            Admin
        ]
        type=USER // Either USER or API
    }
}
```

This file is automatically updated with new entries for users after the first time they log in.

<Callout type='note' title='Coming soon' >

   At present, the only way to edit user-to-role mappings is by modifying this
   file, and subsequently restarting the server.

   We're working on better user mapping tools through the UI, which will be
   available in a future release.

## Authorities

Orbital ships with the following authorities.

In order to perform an activity, users be associated with a role that
grants the related authority.

| Activity                                           | Required authority       |
|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Issue a query through the UI                       | RunQuery                 |
| Issue a query through the API                      | RunQuery                 |
| Cancel a running query                             | CancelQuery              |
| Browse the query history in the UI                 | ViewQueryHistory         |
| View the results of historic queries               | ViewHistoricQueryResults |
| Browse the data catalog                            | BrowseCatalog            |

| Edit an existing pipeline                          | EditPipelines            |
| View authentication tokens Orbital uses in requests| ViewAuthenticationTokens |
| Edit authentication tokens Orbital uses in requests| EditAuthenticationTokens |
| View configured data sources                       | ViewConnections          |
| Edit configured data sources                       | EditConnections          |

## Authorisation parameters
The following parameters are configurable, by passing values
to Orbital on startup.  The values all have reasonable defaults, and it's uncommon to change
these.  However, they can be configured as required.

| Parameter                                                | Description                                                      | Default value                    |
|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `vyne.security.authorisation.role-definitions-file`      | Path to a file which defines roles and their granted authorities | `config/roles.conf`              |
| `vyne.security.authorisation.user-to-role-mappings-file` | Path to a file which lists users, and their assigned roles       | `config/user-role-mappings.conf` |
| `vyne.security.authorisation.admin-role`                 | The name of the role which grants admin privileges.              | `Admin`                          |
