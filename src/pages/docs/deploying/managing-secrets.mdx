title: Managing secrets
---

Generally, when defining either [connections](/docs/describing-data-sources/configuring-connections) or [authentication tokens](/docs/describing-data-sources/authentication-to-services)
you need to store sensitive values.

As Orbital is built around file-based and git-based data stores, these are values you generally don't want checked in.

## Environment variables
All Orbital config files are defined in [HOCON](https://github.com/lightbend/config#examples-of-hocon) format, which allows for variable [substitution](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/main/HOCON.md#substitutions) from the [environment](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/main/HOCON.md#substitution-fallback-to-environment-variables).

When deploying Orbital into production, it's recommended to keep secrets in a secret store (eg., [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)), and inject
them into the environment as part of the machine provisioning process.

Orbital will correctly inject these values into placeholders.

## Using env.conf for sensitive data
In addition to the standard HOCON rules for resolving variables, Orbital supports
the use of a `env.conf` file as a source for substitutions.

This can be useful when developing locally, to ensure that sensitive values aren't accidentally
checked in, but to avoid having to configure environment variables, which can be fiddly.

The general workflow is as follows:
 * Define a `connections.conf` file with your connections, using `${variables}` for placeholders of sensistive data.
 * Create a local `env.conf` file.
* The location of the `env.conf` file must be along side the `connections.conf` file - ie., the path defined in your [taxi.conf file](#declaring-in-your-taxi-project)
 * Populate the env.conf file with sensitive values.

Eg:

<SnippetGroup>

```hocon connections.conf
jdbc {
  my-connection {
    // ... other params omitted for brevity ...
    connectionParams {
      password = ${postgres_password} // Reads the environment variable "postgres_password"
    }
  }
}
  ```

  ```hocon env.conf
  postgres_password=hello123
  ```
