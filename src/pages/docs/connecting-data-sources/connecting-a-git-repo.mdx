}

It's common to have Orbital read definitions direct from a git repository.

## Adding a Git repository using the UI

## Adding a Git repository through config
The schema repositories that Orbital is connected to can be configured through a file, which by default is called `schema-server.conf`


The full documentation for config-driven git repositories is available [here](/docs/deploying/configuring-orbital#configuring-git-repositories).


## Supporting edits to Git repositories
When changes are made to services or taxonomy definitions within Orbital's UI, these need to be written
somewhere.

It's common that these are persisted to a git repository.

Orbital supports two different flows for edits:
 * Committing and pushing directly to the configured branch (default)
 * Committing and pushing to a branch, and raising a Pull Request (Github only)
