title: Configuring connections
---

import {SnippetGroup} from '@/components/SnippetGroup'



The `connections.conf` file defines connections for systems that Orbital understands how to connect to.

A connection is required for most - but not - all data sources (eg., Databases, AWS services, etc).  HTTP connections (OpenAPI / SOAP, etc) are generally self-descriptive
enough not to require additional metadata.

## Declaring in your taxi project
Connections are defined in a `connections.conf`, which lives inside a taxi project within your [workspace](/docs/workspace/overview).

Inside your `taxi.conf` file in your project, declare where you're keeping your config for Orbital.

By convention, this lives at `orbital/config/connections.conf`, but this is configurable.

```hocon taxi.conf
  name: com.myproject/demo
  version: 0.1.0
  sourceRoot: src/
>  additionalSources: {
>      "@orbital/config" : "orbital/config/*.conf"   
>  }
```

Your connections config file is a HOCON file, specifying how to connect to various resources.

For example:

```hocon connections.conf
jdbc {
  orders {
    connectionName = orders
    connectionParameters {
      database = ordersdb
      host = localhost
      username = martypitt
      password = ${superSecretPassword}
      port = 5432

    }
    jdbcDriver = POSTGRES
  }
}
```


<!--
## Choosing between UI vs Config file
All connections can be configured through the UI, using the connection editor and schema editor - this is often
the easiest way to get started.   All connections are stored within the config file, including those configured in the UI.

However, when you're scripting your deployment, or want reproducible environments, it's often preferable to have
configuration that can be checked into version control or scripted.

In those situations, configuring connections via the config file directly is the way to go.
-->

## Passing sensitive data
It may not always be desirable to specify sensitive connection information directly in the config file - especially
if these are being checked into source control.

Environment variables can be used anywhere in the config file, following the [HOCON standards](https://github.com/lightbend/config#uses-of-substitutions).

For example:

```hocon connections.conf
jdbc {
   another-connection {
      connectionName = another-connection
      jdbcDriver = POSTGRES 
      connectionParameters {
         // .. other params omitted for bevity ..
         password = ${postgres_password} // Reads the environment variable "postgres_password"
      }
   }
}
```

### Using env.conf for sensitive data
In addition to the standard HOCON rules for resolving variables, Orbital supports
the use of a `env.conf` file, to define variables.

This can be useful when developing locally, to ensure that sensitive values aren't accidentally
checked in, but to avoid having to configure environment variables, which can be fiddly.

The general workflow is as follows:
 * Define a `connections.conf` file with your connections, using `${variables}` for placeholders of sensistive data.
 * Create a local `env.conf` file.
   * The location of the `env.conf` file must be along side the `connections.conf` file - ie., the path defined in your [taxi.conf file](#declaring-in-your-taxi-project)
 * Populate the env.conf file with sensitive values.

Eg:

<SnippetGroup>

  ```hocon connections.conf
  jdbc {
     my-connection {
        // ... other params omitted for brevity ...
        connectionParams {
          password = ${postgres_password} // Reads the environment variable "postgres_password"
        }
     }
  }
  ```
  
  ```hocon env.conf
  postgres_password=hello123
  ```
</SnippetGroup>


### Correctly handling substitutions in Urls
Substitution of variable inside a Url using Hocon can be tricky.

In short, here's how substitutions need to be defined:

```hocon
query-server {
   // The Url has specifal characters (:), so needs to be inside of quotes.
   // However, variable substitution doesn't work inside of quotes,
   // so the variable must be outside of quotes.
   url="http://"${MY_VARIABLE}":9305"
}
```

For more information, see [this issue](https://github.com/lightbend/config/issues/633) in the Hocon library

## Database connections

Database connections are defined under the `jdbc` element within the `connections.conf` file.

```hocon
jdbc { // The root element for database connections
   another-connection { // Defines a connection called "another-connection"
      connectionName = another-connection // The name of the connection.  Must match the key used above.
      jdbcDriver = POSTGRES // Defines the driver to use.  See below for the possible options
      connectionParameters { // A list of connection parameters.  The actual values here are defined by the driver selected.
         database = transactions // The name of the database
         host = our-db-server // The host of the database
         password = super-secret // The password
         port = "2003" // The port
         username = jack // The username to connect with
      }
   }
}
```

### Supported drivers

### Postgres

To configure a Postgres connection, specify `jdbcDriver = POSTGRES`

Connection parameters are as follows:

| Parameter name | Description                                     |

         username = jack // The username to connect with
      }
   }
}
```

### Snowflake

To configure a Postgres connection, specify `jdbcDriver = SNOWFLAKE`

Connection parameters are as follows:

| Parameter name | Description                                             |

#### Example

```HOCON
jdbc { // The root element for database connections
   another-connection { // Defines a connection called "another-connection"
      connectionName = another-connection // The name of the connection.  Must match the key used above.
      jdbcDriver = SNOWFLAKE // Defines the driver to use.  See below for the possible options
      connectionParameters { // A list of connection parameters.  The actual values here are defined by the driver selected.
        account = mySnowflakeAccount123.eu-west-1
        schema = public
        db = demo_db
        warehouse = COMPUTE_WH
        schema = public
        role = QUERY_RUNNER
      }
   }
}
```


## Kafka connections
Kafka connections are stored in the same config file, under the `kafka` element.

The connection specifies how to connect to a broker - but not the specifics of actual topics.  Those are specified
on the `@KafkaOperation()` metadata on a taxi operation definition.  Read

```
kafka {
   my-kafka-connection {
      connectionName=my-kafka-connection
      connectionParameters {
         brokers="localhost:29092,localhost:39092"
         groupId="orbital"
      }
   }
   another-kafka-connection {
      connectionName=another-kafka-connection
      connectionParameters {
         brokers="localhost:29092,localhost:39092"
         groupId="orbital"
      }
   }
}
```

The following configuration options are supported under the `connectionParameters`

| Config option | Purpose                                                                        |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `brokers`     | A comma-separated list of broker addresses when connecting to the Kafka broker |
| `groupId`     | The groupId to use when connecting to a topic                                  |


## AWS connections
AWS connections are stored under the `aws` element.

Orbital uses AWS connections for example to connect to SQS for data pipelines and other services as part of query execution.

Orbital will use the [AWS default credentials provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-default) by default. This means you can configure the access credentials and region with environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` & `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`). When running Orbital in AWS (e.g. ECS) it'll also automatically pick up the role used to run the service and use that.

You can also configure the AWS connections manually which can be useful in cases where you need to connect to various different AWS accounts from a single installation of Orbital. As with all other config file value, you can either set the value explicitly, or read from an environment variable (as shown).

```hocon
aws {
    my-aws-account {
        connectionName=my-aws-account
        connectionParameters {
            awsAccessKey=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
            awsSecretKey=${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
            awsRegion=${AWS_REGION}

            // Optional parameter for development and testing purposes to point to a different endpoint such as a LocalStack installation.
            endPointOverride=${?AWS_ENDPOINT_OVERRIDE}
        }
    }
}
```

### Testing with Localstack
You can point Orbital at an AWS mock running on [Localstack](https://localstack.cloud/) by specifying the `endPointOverride` property
in the connection.
