title: Enable editing of schemas through the UI
description: Learn how to configure the schema server to allow the Orbital UI to edit schemas directly

import {Callout} from '@/components/Callout';

## Overview

There are several places in the Orbital UI where you can directly create or edit schemas.  For example, when [connecting a database table](/docs/describing-data-sources/databases)

To support editing of schemas through the Orbital UI, the schema server must be configured with a local taxi project, and then have editing enabled.
This guide shows you how to achieve that.

When the Orbital schema server is started, it reads the configuration from a [config file.](/docs/deploying/schema-server/#schema-server-monitored-projects)

This configuration includes a list of repositories which the schema server will monitor.  In this guide, we'll explore adding a repository
which can accept edits from the Orbital UI.

   This guide assumes you already have a taxi project that you want to make editable.
   If not, you might want to follow our guide on [creating a new taxi project](https://taxilang.org/intro/getting-started/) first.

## Add our taxi project to the Schema Server
We now need to add a new repository that contains our Taxi project.
Orbital supports multiple different ways of consuming Taxi projects.  However, currently the only repository
that supports editing through the UI is the Local file project.

### Find your schema-server config file
By default, the Schema Server is configured by a file called `repositories.conf` in the directory where you
launched the Schema Server from.

You may have overridden this when you launched the Schema Server, by specifying `--vyne.repositories.config-file=...`.

If you're running one of our demo tutorials, the config file is at `vyne/schema-server/schema-server.conf`, relative
to the docker-compose file you used.

Find and open the schema-server config file in your editor of choice.

### Specify a new file based repository
Edit the config file, to add a new file repository.

We need to add the path to our newly created taxi project into our config file.

<Callout type='note' title='Use the right path'>

   Ensure you add the path to the **directory** that contains the `taxi.conf` file you just created, but not the taxi.conf itself

    * Correct: `/path/to/directory`
    * Incorrect: `/path/to/directory/taxi.conf`

</Callout>

 * If there's already a `file {}` block in your config file, add your path to the `paths` block, on a new line.
 * If not, copy and paste the below section into your config file, setting the `path` to the desired one:

```HOCON
file {
   paths=[
      "/path/to/project"
   ]
}
```

For more information on configuring file repositories, check out the [reference docs](/docs/deploying/schema-server/#file-repositories).

### Make the file repository editable from the UI
Still in the config file, we need to add one more line, which tells the schema server that any edits are to be written
to our project.

The schema server only supports writing edits to a single repository.

Modify the config file, adding a `apiEditorProjectPath: "path/to/project"` entry, with the same directory you just entered.

```HOCON
file {
   paths=[
      "/path/to/project"
   ]
   apiEditorProjectPath: "path/to/project"
}
```

Now restart the schema server.

### Conclusion
The schema server has now been configured to accept edits via it's API.
Orbital will detect this, and allow edits to be made within the UI, ultimately ending up with files created in our taxi project.
