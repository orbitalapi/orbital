Orbital automates integration for your microservices.  

Get started right now, by spinning up Orbital on your machine

```bash
docker run -p 9022:9022 orbitalhq/orbital
```
Then visit [https://localhost:9022](https://localhost:9022) in your browser.

## What is Orbital?

Orbital is a data gateway that automates the integration, transformation and discovery of data from data sources (API's, databases, message brokers) across your enterprise.

Orbital integrates on-the-fly, automatically adjusting as your data sources change.

This is powered by rich semantic schemas, which infer how data across your organisation links together, and automate the integration and discovery of data.
