title: Performing mutations
description: Triggering updates / mutations using TaxiQL
---

Mutation queries make changes somewhere - ie., perform a task, or update a record.

Mutating operations are defined in Taxi using the `write` modifier:

```taxi
service FlightsService {
  write operation bookFlight(BookingRequest):BookingConfirmation
  write operation sendFlightManifest(Manifest):ManifestConfirmation
}
```

Mutating operations are excluded from being invoked during a query (ie., anything with a `find {}` or `stream {}` directive.)

Instead, they are invoked using a `call` directive.

```taxi
find { Passengers[] }
call FlightsService::sendFlightManifest
```

In this example, a list of `Passengers` is fetched, and converted into a `Manifest` to call the `sendFlightManifest` operation
of the `FlightsService`.
