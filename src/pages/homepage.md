Automated integration for microservices
Orbital eliminates the integration effort, so you can get back to shipping

## Connect APIs, Databases, Queues and more, on-the-fly

Orbital uses metadata in your OpenAPI specs & schemas to integrate data sources on demand.

Query for data using TaxiQL, and Orbital handles the integration - linking
database queries, API calls and streaming data sources on demand.

As things change, Orbital automatically adapts.

## 1 - Publish and link your APIs

Publish your API specs and Database schemas to Orbital, enriched with Taxi metadata to describe links.

Orbital turns this into rich API and data catalog, letting you explore all your data, and how it connects

## 2 - Query for data

Write a query in TaxiQL - a declarative query language that focusses on What data you want, not how to get it.

Orbital uses your APIs and metadata to create integrations on-the-fly for you.

## 3 - Change and Adapt

Update your API specs, publishing new versions with metadata.

Orbital tests for breaking changes, and adapts integrations on-the-fly - so consumers don't have to.
