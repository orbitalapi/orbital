# Setting up Vyne locally

Before you build your first Vyne service you need a running instance of Vyne on your local machine. By far the simplest way is to run it using docker-compose. 

Sample docker-compose file can be found in our [vyne-docker-stack](https://gitlab.com/vyne/demos/-/tree/master/vyne-docker-stack) demo project. Please follow the instructions before going to next section.
