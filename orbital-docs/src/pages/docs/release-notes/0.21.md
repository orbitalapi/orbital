This page contains details of releases in the 0.21.xx set of releases.

## 0.21.0

0.21 is a minor feature release

#### Taxi Version
Taxi has been upgraded to 1.33.6

### Improved validation framework
When parsing data, validation errors can occur when data presented
doesn't adhere to the data contract defined in the schema.

This validation framework provides fine-grained control over how to react
when validation errors occur, and how to recover.

Initially, this has been deployed in pipelines, which manifests as richer logging when data pipeline ingestion errors occur.

The validation improvements will be deployed more broadly in a later release, including handling of validation errors in operations.

### Fix: Better null handling when importing CSV's
We have addressed several issues where CSV's that were parsed with nulls or empty strings could cause
parsing to fail.

### Upgraded dependencies
This release contains several internal dependencies that have been upgraded, as we move
to more aggressively stay in line with the latest releases from 3rd party dependencies.
