`vynetest` is a command line  tool that lets you execute tests. It's designed to be run as part of a test-driven CI/CD approach to taxonomy design.

## Getting the test tool

The test tool is available to download [here](http://repo.vyne.co/testcli.html). The tool is built using Java, and you are expected to have a JRE installed.

We ship scripts for running `vynetest` on either Windows or Linux/Mac environments.

* bin/vynetest.bat for Windows
* bin/vynetest for Mac and Linux

Download, and unzip the tools. For the best experinece, we recommend adding the `vynetest` command to your PATH.

### Docker image

Alternatively, a docker image is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/vyneco/vynetest) at `vyneco/vynetest`

```text
docker pull vyneco/vynetest:latest
```

The docker image expects to find the base taxi project mounted as a volume named `/work`.  Therefore, execution of tests using docker might look something like the following:

```text
docker run -v ${PWD}:/work vyneco/vynetest
```

The docker image defaults to running the `test` command, but this can be overridden by specifying a command.

For example, to show the version of the tool bundled into the docker image, execute the following:

```text
docker run -v ${PWD}:/work vyneco/vynetest -v
```

### Help & Version

Executing `vynetest` will give you a list of the available commands

`vynetest -v` will show the version installed.

## Model parsing tests

Model parsing tests allow you to test data feeds are parsed correctly against their Taxi based definitions

### Running a test

From within a directory containing tests, execute:

```text
vynetest test
Usage: testcli test [-p=<specPath>]
  -p, --path=<specPath>   The directory of specs
```

This will search for test spec files below the current directory.

You can optionally specify a path to search by using the `-p` or `--path` options.

### Typical project layout

```text
.
├── src/
│   └── sample.taxi
├── tests/
│   └── hello-world/
│       ├── hello-world.spec.json
│       ├── input.csv
│       └── expected-output.json
└── taxi.conf
```

<Hint>
You can choose any layout you wish, what we've provided is a recommended standard, but the tooling is fairly flexible. Consider the following rules

* `vynetest` will look downward in each folder and subfolder recursively for test files \(`*.spec.json`\)
* For each test spec file it finds, vynetest will look upwards for a `taxi.conf` file defining the taxonomy to use to test with
</Hint>

### Layout of a test case

Each test is a directory containing at least 3 files:

* A spec config file
* An input to parse
* An expected output

eg:

```text
.
└── hello-world/  (A directory containing a single test)
    ├──  hello-world.spec.json (The spec)
    ├── input.json (The input to parse)
    └── expected.json (A file describing the expected result of parsing)
```

#### Spec config file

This is a JSON file defining the configuration of the specific test case.

It can be named anything, but must end with `spec.json`.

By convention, we suggest naming the file after the name of the test.

eg: `simple-hello-world.spec.json`

A minimal spec contains the following parts:

* `name`: the name of the test, displayed in test output
* `source`: the source file to be read
* `expected`: the expected output.  Normally, this is obtained by downloading from within Vyne's Data Explorer.
* `targetType`: The type which the input should be projected against.

Here's a sample file:

```javascript
{
  "name": "simple hello world",
  "source": "input.json",
  "expected": "expected.json",
  "targetType": "vyne.demo.Person"
}
```

#### Expected output

The expected file is a specific format generated by Vyne. It's a JSON file describing the expected results of parsing the input.

The easiest way to create an expected output file, is to generate on through Vyne's Data Explorer

### Generating a Test Spec through Vyne

The entire test spec can be generated through Vyne's UI.

Import a file into Vyne's data explorer as you would normally, specifying the type.

The parsed content appears in the Parsed Data tab.  Click to download - and choose to download as a test spec:

When prompted, provide a name for the test, and click Download

A zip file containing the 3 files required is downloaded.  Unzip the file into the directory within your taxonomy containing the tests
