Both\nSwagger & RAML are obvious influences into the design of Taxi. I’ve been a big\nproponent, heavy user, & OSS contributor\n[https://github.com/springfox/springfox] around Swagger for a number of years.\nThey’re great tools, and I having a huge respect for them.\n\nHowever, there are limitations that I’d hit which frustrated me as user of\nSwagger, and there are things I was trying to achieve when building Vyne\n[https://vyne.co] that just weren’t possible with current tooling.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that Swagger & RAML are both mature tools, whereas Taxi is\nsitting at v0.1. So, some of the goals outlined here indicate where we’re going,\nrather than where we are today.\n\nRead & Writeability\nSoftware is first & foremost a communication & storytelling medium. Good code is\nalways measured by how well other people - not machines — are able to understand\nit.\n\nWhether that’s through self documenting code, ubiquitous language\n[https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html], documentation hubs,\nBDD test suites, etc. Whatever techniques you choose to employ, the verdict is\nclear — The ability to capture, share and replay ideas between colleagues is a\nkey factor in successful projects.\n\nSwagger & RAML aren’t good communication formats for people — they’re simply too\nverbose. It’s a symptom of electing JSON & YAML as their languages — the content\nof the message gets lost in the noise of the syntax.\n\nLook at these two snippets, both which communicate the same concept:\n\nSwagger vs Taxi — short & sweetThrough brevity, Taxi becomes more writable by\nhand — which, it turns out, is a key facet for promoting readability, and\nencourages using Taxi to exchange ideas.\n\nTypes as a documentation tool\nTaxi also has microtypes as a first class concept — aliasing primitives with\nmore descriptive names. This promotes embedding the UbiquitousLanguage directly\nwithin the DSL, and the language as a first class citizen within the type\nsystem.\n\nConsider the same example, this time with Microtypes added in:\n\ntype Pet {\n  id : PetId as Int\n  name : Name as String\n  tag : Tag as String\n}\n\nBy leveraging microtypes, the rest of our API documentation becomes much clearer\ntoo:\n\noperation findPet(String):Pet\n// vs\noperation findPet(Name):Pet\n\noperation deletePet(Int)\n// vs\noperation deletePet(PetId)\n\nNote that as Taxi is a documentation tool, (not a run-time), often we can omit\nparameter names in operations entirely, and the result is actually more \nreadable.\n\nIt also has the benefit that tooling can now make smarter choices around what to\nprovide to the deletePet() operation — not just any old Int will do, it needs to\nbe a PetId.\n\nExtensibility\nAPI documentation exists to help consumers integrate. However, integration is a\ntwo-party party, and Swagger ignores one of those parties.\n\nSwagger provides no way for consumers of an API to take the spec, and mix-in\nconsumer specific information.\n\nFor example, dumping an object straight to a DB, using JPA — a fairly common\ntask. Given our models are generated from the Swagger spec, it’d be nice as\nconsumer to simply mix-in the annotations for JPA, and be done with it.\n\nSometimes, Swagger models are a boundary concern, and consumers will convert the\ninbound object to a type specific to the domain. When that adds value, it’s a\nsensible pattern to apply. However, if your domain model and the swagger type\nare the same, then that’s just pure duplication, without merit.\n\nTaxi supports type extensions to fulfil this need, allowing consumers to mix in\ndefinitions that are meaningful to them:\n\ntype extension Pet {\n   @Id id\n}\n\nThe compiler / generator API is designed to allow plugins, so consumers can\nconnect a JPA specific annotation processor, and bosh — JPA annotations on your\ngenerated model. Lovely.\n\nDescribing behaviour, not just existence.\nSwagger and RAML describe the existence of operations— the address you can find\na service at, and broadly what parameters you need to pass.\n\nTaxi aims to go beyond, and describe the purpose of the operation — what happens\nwhen you call an operation, and what constraints must you satisfy before doing\nso.\n\n// Constraints on inputs describe preconditions...\noperation calculateCreditRisk(Money(currency = 'GBP')) : CreditRisk\n\n// ...which others can then help satisfy:\noperation convertCurrency(source : Money, target : Currency) : Money( from source,  currency = target )\n\nThis provides a model that tooling — such as Vyne [https://vyne.co]— can use to\nunderstand how & when to call services, and how to chain services together to\nachieve goals.\n\nThe contract DSL is one of the most interesting aspects of Taxi, but it’s also\nfairly early in it’s implementation — I expect to see this evolve significantly\nover the coming months. I’m also watching with a keen eye how others in similar\nspaces are tackling the issue — Kotlin’s new Contracts DSL\n[https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/3490e847fe51aa6deb869654029a5a514638700e/proposals/kotlin-contracts.md]\nis really interesting.\n\nSummary\nTaxi is just getting going, but I think it offers real strengths over Swagger &\nRAML.\n\nStrong interoperability with the existing tools is a design goal of Taxi.\nUltimately, Taxi should exist as a superset of what’s expressible with Swagger.\n\nNow’s a great time to provide feedback and input into the language as it\nevolves, to make sure we’re building a first-class DSL for describing API’s.\nWe’ve just created our community over on Spectrum, so stop by and join the\nconversation [https://spectrum.chat/taxi].","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490650404312-a2175773bbf5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2018-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","updated_at":"2019-07-15T20:09:36.000Z","published_at":"2018-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"\nI was asked recently about the limitations of Swagger et al that had encouraged me to write Taxi.\n","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://medium.com/@martypitt/taxi-vs-swagger-raml-7fd3faee7aaa"},{"id":"6003105306f7d4099cfeb0c5","uuid":"ed1d75b4-c54d-4573-82fb-d6febde92ced","title":"Going beyond Service Discovery with Capability Discovery","slug":"going-beyond-service-discovery-with-capability-discovery","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"strong\"],[\"code\"],[\"a\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://vyne.co\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://stackedit.io/\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Vyne: An Enterprise Data Mesh and Capability Concierge\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"With the meteoric rise of microservices,  existing service discovery approaches simply don't cut it anymore.

They may\nhave had to visit five different individual theatre websites, or maybe logged on\nto Ticketek.com. It could be that a new theatre or a new show has opened, or\npossibly the concierge is on a mailing list of last minute ticket returns. You\ndon’t need to know about any of that - the concierge is actually doing true\ndiscovery for you.\n\nThe world around the question evolves constantly, but as the person who’s\nasking, we don’t want to or need to know any of that. The basic need has been\nresolved by the concierge.\n\nSimilarly in software, we want to abstract ourselves away from the detail, to\nfocus on Getting Stuff Done.  Consider a simple requirement -- given a\ncustomers' email address, re-order their last purchase.  However, this requires\nstitching together multiple different services,  to go from the customer email\nto customer number to last order made to name of the product(s) to the SKU, to a\nstock service that tells me if there’s any of those in stock.\n\nFundamentally, I don't care about the journey & hops required - I just want to\nget stuff done, and be abstracted away from the details.\n\nYou can't survive on Swagger alone.\nVarious tooling and languages have emerged to improve how we document and share\nAPIs – but they don’t go far enough to address the inefficiencies of\nintegration. Tools such as Swagger and RAML are great for describing an API, but\nfall short when it comes to describing capability.\n\nFor example, the Swagger contract for a service that takes in a customer ID and\nreturns a customer name, is actually just described as taking a String and\nreturning a String. It doesn’t describe what that service actually does, and\nthere’s nothing that differentiates that contract from the contract that takes a\npostcode and gives you back a city name.\n\nWithout systems describing their capability, concierge services aren't possible\n-- and it ultimately falls back to a developer to read and understand the\nSwagger API, generate an SDK, and write, test and maintain the integration code.\n\nThis happens again and again for every different service they need to call in\norder to achieve their end goal.\n\nWorse, much of this work happens repeatedly across the organisation; one\ndeveloper needs to get from system A to system B, and two weeks later another\ndeveloper in another team has to go through exactly the same loop.\n\nNot only is this time consuming and wasteful, but the resulting code is fragile\n– when one part of the path changes, consumer’s plumbing code needs to adapt, or\nsystems may break down.\n\nThe true cost of changing an API lies with consumers (who need to update their\ncode). This means the most popular services are inherently the ones with the\nhighest cost of change. This creates an inertia to change – it’s often just not\nworth the time and effort involved – and systems start to decay.\n\nFor every £1M spent on building software a further £2.8M will be spent\nintegrating it\n(Forrester  Research)\n\nForrester Research estimates that for every £1M spent to build the systems,\n£2.8M is spent integrating them. That means three quarters of the development\nwork is the boring, repetitive plumbing tasks the developers don’t enjoy, which\nisn't core business, and does nothing to generate revenue.\n\nWhat innovation might happen once you free up that significant developer\nresource? The question becomes “What can we do?” which is value-add, rather than\n“How do we do it?” which is value-drag.\n\nHello, Vyne: an enterprise data mesh and service concierge\nVyne turns your existing microservices into a Data Mesh, automating integration\nbetween your services.  Think of Vyne as your digital concierge - there to help\nyou get stuff done.\n\nAs we've talked about before, we  addressed the shortfall in tools like Swagger\nand RAML, by building tooling that allows services to describe the actual\ncapabilities they offer – not just their schemas.\n\nServices register with Vyne – just like they would with service discovery – and\npublish the capabilities they offer. Vyne uses this information to build a mesh\nof the capabilities of all of your services.\n\nThen, instead of developers building point-to-point integration solutions,\nconsumers send their requests to Vyne, in a form of “Given this thing I know,\nhere’s what I’d like to do / like to discover”.\n\nVyne acts as an intelligent API Gateway, and uses its knowledge of the service\nmesh to orchestrate an automated “Just-in-time” integration plan – calling the\nright services to discover the right data, and passing information from\nservice-to-service, to perform the required task.\n\nVyne can apply intelligent problem solving along the route – understanding when\ndata is missing, in the wrong format, or some other contract hasn’t been\nsatisfied – and attempts to find other services to address the issue.\n\nFinally, because the consumer code is entirely decoupled from the services and\ncontracts that it calls, the cost and friction of change is significantly\nreduced. Vyne’s integration plans automatically adapt as services evolve,\nwithout consumers needing to change their code.\n\nAutomating the plumbing makes for happier developers, lower development costs,\nand integrated systems that are robust, adaptable and optimally serve the needs\nof the business. All good news.\n\nContact us for a demo to learn how to evolve your API strategy with Vyne: \nhello@vyne.co.\n\nOr, head over to https://vyne.co to get started now.\n\nWritten with StackEdit [https://stackedit.io/].","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2019-07-15T19:02:01.000Z","updated_at":"2019-07-18T08:37:03.000Z","published_at":null,"custom_excerpt":"\nVyne is a toolkit for automating the integration of services.

The reality is that most API strategies\ntoday put too much cost on the consumer:\n\n * The cost of discovery - finding the right API which serves the data you're\n   looking for in a large organisation can be tough\n * The cost of integration - The initial build out of integration takes time.\n    OpenAPI tooling helps, but it's wins are very short-lived.\n * The cost of maintenance - The silent killer.  As producers change their APIs,\n   this burden of change flows downstream to all consumers. \n\nThe worst part of consumer facing costs are they are repeated - integrating APIs\nis a tax that dev teams pays repeatedly in order to get and retain access to\ninformation. \n\nOrganisations with internal API strategies are paying this tax over and over,\nfor every new consumer that spins up.\n\n> ...Integrating APIs is a tax that dev teams pays repeatedly in order to get and\nretain access to information. \nThis high cost of change leads to a paradox of success - the more consumers an\nAPI has, the higher the number of points to change, meaning the more expensive\nit is to evolve.  As a result, some services simply become too critical to\nevolve, and their unmaintained APIs continue to spread - like a forgotten ham\nsandwich in the bottom of  kids schoolbag.\n\nSwagger is not a (consumer) strategy\nSwagger/OpenAPI - and their newest incarnation, Service Catalogues - are great\ntools.  However, the traditional adoption patterns in using OpenAPI results in\nbuilding horribly brittle architectures.  Swagger's \"SDKs for APIs\" is really\njust tooling that helps tightly couple interfaces across the enterprise.\n\nWhether you're using OpenAPI codegen tools, service catalogues to help find\nAPIs, or UI based drag-and-drop integrators, these are all tools that facilitate\ntight coupling between consumers and producers.  As a result, whenever upstream\nAPIs change, consumers are obligated to update along with them.\n\n> Swagger/OpenAPI - and their newest incarnation, Service Catalogues - are great\ntools for building horribly brittle architectures. \nThat's not to say that OpenAPI documentation isn't great - it is.  So is\nProtobuf,  gRPC, GraphQL - even WSDLs for that matter ... we need more, richer,\nbetter API documentation.  (Heck, that's why we built Taxi\n[https://docs.taxilang.org]) \n\nAnd, API publishers should be held accountable for producing accurate detailed\nAPI docs, in a machine readable format. (README.md and whatever Wiki software\nexists in your enterprise doesn't count).\n\nBut, our thinking around consumer patterns needs to evolve beyond expecting\nconsumers to hitch their wagon to whatever producers publish.\n\nPut simply, today's API consumer patterns facilitate rapidly producing tightly\ncoupled services.  That's clearly nuts.\n\nConsumers want information.  APIs are a producers concern - and one we should\nabstract away from.\nConsumers just need access to information - they shouldn't have to care about\nthe mechanics of APIs.  Really, a consumer just needs to define two things:\n\n * Defining the data they want\n * Defining the shape they want it\n\nEverything outside of this is an implementation concern - and one that we should\nbe abstracting consumers away from.\n\nIf a producer has done a good enough job of documenting their APIs - the data\nthey expose and their \"rules of engagement\" - then software should be handling\nthe API interaction.\n\nConsumer patterns need to evolve towards a dynamic knowledge broker that\nfacilitates delivering data, as the consumer needs it, without coupling\nconsumers and producers together. (Spoiler alert: this is what we build\n[https://vyne.co], but I'll come back to that).\n\nProducers should be free to evolve their APIs without worrying about the\ncascading change of all their consumers.  After all - that's what microservices\nand Agile practices promised, right - small, autonomous teams iterating and\ndelivering at pace.  Instead, what we got was a mess of integration code and\nchange committees to ensure releases don't break consumers.\n\n> ...[we need] a dynamic knowledge broker that facilitates delivering data, as the\nconsumer needs it, without coupling consumers and producers together. \nFederated GraphQL isn't the answer either\nThoughtworks [https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar#graphql-grandiosity] recently\nphrased this beautifully - GraphQL is certainly \"having it's moment\".\n\nGraphQL was designed as a tool for reducing HTTP traffic for Web traffic to a\nbackend, and cherry-picking data attributes from a predefined domain model.\n And, for this purpose, it really is a remarkable tool.\n\nHowever, GraphQL was never intended as a back-end federation strategy. And,\nwhile it seems some tools are pushing in this direction, it's a much less\ncompelling offering.\n\nImportantly, different services across an enterprise have different data domain\nmodels - and that's a Good Thing - teams should be free to express ideas in ways\nthat are meaningful to them, regardless of duplication.  GraphQL doesn't try to\nsolve this problem. \n\nAnd while GraphQL does allow consumers to opt-out of the data they don't care\nabout, accessing new data, or data in a different shape still incurs an\nintegration tax that adds no value.\n\nGlobally shared domain models - whether that's a GraphQL schema, or an\n\"Enterprise Domain Model\" - is not an effective knowledge distribution strategy:\n\n * It restricts how information can be distributed - limiting only to what the\n   schema can express. \n * It requires that all consumers consume data in the same shape.  Attempting to\n   feed data downstream to another?  You're out of luck, it's a\n   one-size-fits-all policy around here, bub.\n * It ultimately results in a (deferred) cascading change, when the schema\n   ultimately needs to evolve.\n\nSummary\nAPIs are great, if you're a producer.  But consumer patterns haven't evolved,\nand today lead to tightly coupled services.\n\nEnterprises need new middleware knowledge brokers, that facilitate discovery of\ndata, without tightly coupling producers and consumers, and without incurring\nthe massive integration tax.\n\nIn our next post, we'll talk about how to achieve this, using Vyne.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1599408278953-e10a56e5c88d?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDc3fHxwbHVnfGVufDB8fHw&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=2000","featured":1,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2021-01-18T11:35:02.000Z","updated_at":"2021-01-21T09:33:38.000Z","published_at":"2021-01-18T11:35:15.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Technology organisations have adopted API's at the heart of their IT strategy.

If a broker understands the suite of services available and what they offer, we can reduce the amount of knowledge that consumers need to have.\\n\\n![blog-images](/content/images/2021/01/blog-images.png)\\n\\nRather than consumers becoming coupled to every API that provides the data they need, they can simply ask the broker for the information, and let it do the work - like asking a hotel concierge for local information.\\n\\n![blog-images--1-](/content/images/2021/01/blog-images--1-.png)\\n\\nGraphQL is a great example of this idea in action - providing a single API entrypoint, that acts as a facade to multiple back-end services.  (We love GraphQL, but think that it doesn't go far enough in decoupling - more on that later).\\n\\nTo work well, a broker should:\\n\\n- **Allow consumers to discover information without becoming coupled to the producers**\\n- **Allow consumers to ask for data in a shape that's meaningful to them.**\\n  This whole affair is pointless if the first step consumers take is to map fetched data into another object.  \\n  Since we've already decoupled the producers and consumers, let's allow the consumer to simply request it's own domain object, removing the additional mapping step entirely.\\n- **Adapt to change automatically.**\\n  As producers evolve, integrations should automatically adapt.  After all, \\\"automation\\\" that requires manual updates on every change isn't automation, it's work-shifting. \\n\\n>  ...\\\"automation\\\" that requires manual updates on every change isn't automation, it's work-shifting. \\n\\nTo do this:\\n\\n- We'd need a shared way for producers and consumers to describe data and capability, without requiring a global shared domain model\\n- Schema information needs to be rich enough that the API broker can automatically determine which service (or services) to call in order to satisfy a request\\n\\n## Integrate information, don't glue labels\\n\\nThe key piece to making this work is how we describe and integrate information between systems.  \\n\\nMost integration approaches boil down to linking labels in maps - connecting the key of one key/value pair from within some nested maps to the label of another.   \\n\\nLayer on as many fancy Integration Builder UI's, swagger-generated SDK's or GraphQL resolvers as you like - peel back the layers, and it's still just labels 'n' glue.  Rename those labels, and the whole thing just falls apart.\\n\\n![blog-images--2-](/content/images/2021/01/blog-images--2-.png)\\n\\nNot only is this really brittle, it's a really error-prone approach - schemas tend to lack sufficient detail to do this label matching unambiguously - so we fall back to inline comments and wiki pages to explain which field to use in which circumstance.  While documentation is better than nothing, it's not something we can leverage for automation.\\n\\nIronically, API authors will debate for hours on whether to use JSON or YAML for their Swagger schema, PUT vs POST, how to capitalise words, to indent with tabs or spaces, and how many.  But disambiguating which string represents the buyer and seller in a transaction?  Pfft! Someone else will work that out.\\n\\n>  API authors will debate for hours on whether to use JSON or YAML for their Swagger schema, PUT vs POST, spaces vs tabs, etc.  \\n>  \\n>  But clarifying which string represents the buyer and seller in a transaction?  Pfft! Someone else will work that out.\\n\\n### ***What*** matters.\\n\\n> Data models actually represent two contracts - What and Where\\n\\nPart of the challenge here is that data models have two contracts - **what** data you'll find, and **where** to find it.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n* \\\"You'll find the number we use to identify the customer...\\\" (what)\\n* \\\"...in a field called `id`\\\" (where)\\n\\nGenerally speaking, API schemas focus almost exclusively on documenting structure, and do a terrible job of describing *what* information they actually contain - simply describing everything as a bunch of `String`, `Integer` and `Boolean` values.\\n\\n> API Schemas are great a telling you ***where*** to find stuff, but <u>terrible</u> at describing ***what*** you'll find there.\\n\\n![blog-images--3-](/content/images/2021/01/blog-images--3-.png)\\n\\nHowever, because we have no unambiguous, cross-system way of saying \\\"This is the Customer Number\\\", we fall back using labels - like a poor co-ordinates system: \\\"Read the word customer, and then the word id and there you shall find your answer.\\\"\\n\\nIf our schemas could do a better job of describing what information they hold, then both discovery of information and mapping content between systems becomes much more automatable. We can simply read the `CustomerId`, regardless of whether a system used the label `id`, `CustomerId`, `custId`, or `Customer`.\\n\\n\\n#### Sharing models:  Ew, David. Gross.\\nWe also need to be careful not to head down the path of enterprise shared models - those don't work.  \\n\\nConstraining independent systems to use shared contracts makes change really hard.  Also, it doesn't actually save any time - You're just left with more mapping layers - the \\\"shared model\\\" gets mapped to the internal domain model, simply moving the work.  \\n\\nThese mapping layers result in the kind of low-value busywork they're designed to prevent, and that we're trying to avoid.\\n\\n> Globally shared models create the type of low-value mapping busywork they're designed to prevent, and that we're trying so hard to avoid.\\n\\n\\n### Two roles of schema: Structure and Content\\n\\nIt turns out there's actually two different types of contract present within our schemas - structure and content.\\n\\nStrutcural contracts are useful to tell systems where to find...something, but as we've seen, they do little to describe what information you'll find there.\\n\\nWe need a better way of describing the content in each field.  As it turns out, software systems have *great* mechanisms for categorising information - Types.\\n\\nBy Types, I don't mean primitives like `String`, `Integer` (we're already using those, and it's not working).  I mean a creating something richer - more aligned to the business vocabulary - a shared set of semantic terms, and building a type system around them: `FirstName`, `LastName`, `CustomerId`.\\n\\nOnce we model content, independent of structure, we can start matching on things that share meaning, regardless of what they're called:\\n\\n![blog-images--5-](/content/images/2021/01/blog-images--5-.png)\\n\\nIn order to avoid falling into the \\\"shared model\\\" trap, Types need to be so small, that they describe content, but without requiring structure.  Small and simple - attributes with a Single Responsibility.\\n\\nMore specifically in this paradigm, Types should be Scalar - ideas that can be represented without attributes.  As soon as a Type adopts attributes - it starts modelling both meaning and structure - so is actually likely multiple ideas mixed together.  This keeps types related to a single idea - a single word in our shared vocabulary.\\n\\nOf course, a shared vocabulary in software isn't a new idea - agile practitioners have long advocated for a Ubiquitous Language.  All we're suggesting is making this vocabulary a first-class citizen of API documentation and tooling.  \\n\\n> Agile practitioners have long advocated for a Ubiquitous Language - all we're suggesting is making this a first-class citizen of API documentation and tooling.  \\n\\nThese ideas of semantic types aren't new either - and while similar toolsets such as RDF / OWL / JSON-LD have been around for some time, their learning curve have prevented adoption.  Therefore, it's important that whatever we build must be simple, readable, and writable.\\n\\nBy building out a rich language of simple Types, we get the building blocks to describe our API models with, and giving us two distinct concepts within our schema space - Types (describing the \\\"What\\\") and Models (describing the structure).\\n\\nLet's define those a little more formally:\\n\\n#### Types\\nTypes represent a single atom of information - a set of shared business concepts used to exchange information - such as `FirstName`, `LastName`, `CustomerId`, `DateOfBirth`, etc.   We've found that once defined, these don't change very frequently.  \\n\\nTypes are scalar (attribute-free), single purpose, and seldom change, making them good candidates for sharing.  Types are owned and curated collectively, and while (at the beginning) new terms emerge fairly frequently, changes to definitions are less common.\\n\\n#### Models\\nModels are owned by individual systems (the ones that produce the model), and evolve rapidly.  Composed of types, they are reshaped, tweaked, with information added and removed frequently - changing with pace as teams ship and refactor functionality.  Models describe their attributes using types from the shared taxonomy.\\n\\nHaving introduced these two key building blocks, let talk about the tooling we built to support this idea.\\n\\n\\n## Using Taxi to describe, and Vyne to discover\\n\\nWe built [Taxi](https://docs.taxilang.org) to address the semantic gap in the schema toolchain - a way to build a semantic taxonomy, and apply it to APIs.  \\n\\nTaxi can work either as a stand-alone API schema, or to decorate existing API Schemas, overlaying semantic context.  This means you don't have to throw away all your swagger, you can just mix in some taxi.\\n\\nTaxi's goals are human readability, descriptiveness, and extensibility.  You can write Taxi by hand (unlike Swagger), or generate it from code.  Taxi is [open-source](https://gitlab.com/taxi-lang/taxi-lang), type-safe and functionally rich. \\n\\nBecause it's a custom built language, Taxi is much easier to read than Swagger or RAML, which have been shoe-horned into JSON and YAML.  \\n\\nTaxi's syntax borrows heavily from languages like Typescript and Kotlin, which have gained adoption in large part because they're designed to be approachable.  We think this is a big difference against other languages in this space, such as JSON-LD, OWL or RDF, which have a much higher barrier-to-entry.\\n\\nLet's explore how adding some semantic sugar to our API might look.\\n\\nFirst, let's define some Types and Models:\\n\\n```typescript\\ntype FirstName inherits String\\ntype LastName inherits String\\ntype CustomerId inherits Int\\ntype EmailAddress inherits String\\ntype PrimaryEmailAddress inherits EmailAddress\\n\\nmodel Customer {\\n  firstName : FirstName\\n  lastName : LastName\\n  email : PrimaryEmailAddress\\n  secondaryEmail : EmailAddress\\n  customerId : CustomerId\\t\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAnd finally, a microservice that's using these:\\n\\n```typescript\\nservice CustomerService {\\n  @HttpOperation(method=\\\"GET\\\", url=\\\"http://customers/{id}\\\")\\n  operation getCustomer(id: CustomerId):Customer\\n}\\n```\\n\\nGiven this description, it quickly becomes apparent that if I know a `CustomerId`, I can get a `Customer`.  And, if I have a `Customer`, I have access to a bunch of information about them, like their `FirstName`, and `PrimaryEmailAddress`.  \\n\\nAt this point, the data is sufficiently described that someone can ask for data, agnostic of the service providing it, or the shape it comes in.  \\n\\nFor example, as a consumer of data, I could simply ask it something like:\\n\\n```typescript\\ngiven {\\n  id : CustomerId = 123\\n} find {\\n  name : FirstName\\n  emails: {\\n    primary: PrimaryEmailAddress\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAs a consumer request, I've outlined both the semantic contract, and the structural contract I'd like satisfied here.

And, if I have a Customer, I have access to a bunch of\ninformation about them, like their FirstName, and PrimaryEmailAddress.\n\nAt this point, the data is sufficiently described that someone can ask for data,\nagnostic of the service providing it, or the shape it comes in.\n\nFor example, as a consumer of data, I could simply ask it something like:\n\ngiven {\n  id : CustomerId = 123\n} find {\n  name : FirstName\n  emails: {\n    primary: PrimaryEmailAddress\n  }\n}\n\n\nAs a consumer request, I've outlined both the semantic contract, and the\nstructural contract I'd like satisfied here. However, I haven't talked about\nservices at all - as a consumer, they're not really of concern to me.\n\nThere's enough information for a broker to leverage this, and invoke the correct\nservice to satisfy my request.\n\nOr, if I need my data in a different structure, I can simply ask:\n\ngiven {\n  customerId: CustomerId = 123\n} find {\n  name: FirstName + ' ' + LastName // Taxi supports basic operations\n  contactDetails : {\n    preferredEmail : PrimaryEmailAddress\n    // allEmails would contain both \"email\" and \"secondaryEmail\", since they're both of type EmailAddress\n    allEmails : EmailAddress[] \n  }\n}\n\n\nIt's entirely up to the consumer to determine the shape of the data they want.\n\nSince we've decoupled the structure from the content, there's enough information\nfor a broker to leverage find and construct the object, without having to\nmaintain a manual mapping layer for every attribute.\n\n> By describing both structure and content in the schema, there's enough\ninformation for a broker to find and construct an object, without having to\nmaintain a mapping for every attribute.\n\n\nThis is where Vyne [https://vyne.co] comes in. Vyne is our discovery engine -\ncapable of understanding semantic schemas, and leveraging that information to\nautomatically discover data.\n\nInter-service orchestration\nSince our services now have a shared language for describing inputs and outputs\n(decoupled from structure), we can even leverage this to push inter-service\norchestration up to Vyne.\n\nLet's add another service into the mix:\n\ntype AcceptsMarketingEmails inherits Boolean\ntype AllowsCookieTracking inherits Boolean\n\nmodel MarketingPreferences {\n  emailAddress : EmailAddress\n  cookies : AllowsCookieTracking\n  marketingEmails : AcceptsMarketingEmails\n}\n\nservice MarketingService {\n  @HttpOperation(method=\"GET\", url=\"http://marketingPreferences/{emailAddress}\")\n  operation getMarketingPreferences(emailAddress:PrimaryEmailAddress):MarketingPreferences\n}\n\n\nWe now have a separate producer microservice that's exposing information about\nmarketing preferences.\n\nAs a consumer, I can request data, agnostic of where it's coming from:\n\ngiven {\n  id : CustomerId = 123\n} find {\n  // Provided by our original CustomerService\n  name : FirstName \n  \n  // Provided by our original CustomerService\n  emailAddress : PrimaryEmailAddress \n  \n  // Provided by the new MarketingService\n  canSendMarketingEmails : AcceptsMarketingEmails \n}\n\n\nThere's enough breadcrumbs to build a path:\n\nOriginal CustomerId -> CustomerRecord -> PrimaryEmailAddress -> MarketingPreferences\n\n\n// TODO : Replace the above with a lineage screenshot from Vyne.\n\nWe're able to see here that Vyne was able to bridge multiple services,\nautomatically passing data from one to the next.\n\nSummary\nStructure and Semantics are two different types of contracts, and most API\nschemas at the moment fail to model semantics in a meaningful way.\n\nBy creating a taxonomy of shared terms, and overlaying this taxonomy onto our\nschemas, we have enough information for tools such as Vyne to perform rich,\ncomplex data discovery operations.\n\nFinally, by decoupling consumers from both producer services and structural\ncontracts, the producers are free to evolve and change at will, without forcing\nconsumers to upgrade.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about Vyne, please get in touch [marty@vyne.co] -\nI'd love to hear from you.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2021-01-20T14:21:58.000Z","updated_at":"2021-03-04T06:06:05.000Z","published_at":null,"custom_excerpt":"In this post, we'll explore how by adding a tiny bit more metadata to our APIs, we can offload all the integration work to a broker, who can do all the information gathering for us - like a conceirge in a classy hotel.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"60cb1363221a58108416542b","uuid":"e93263d9-6e23-4f6e-8a92-57ca495415f6","title":"Uniting similar data from multiple sources","slug":"uniting-similar-data","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"There’s plenty of legitimate cases where your company could have ended up with multiple services providing what is essentially the same type of data.

However, it’s\nimportant to remember they’re a means to an end: Facilitating data discovery.\n\nIn this post, we look at how teams are evolving towards decentralized\nresponsibilities, and how open source tools are helping with this.  We also look\nat emerging trends to ask what comes after a catalog - what does the future of\ncatalogs look like, to further lower the cost of data discovery across the\nenterprise.\n\nThe desire to catalog it all\nData Catalogs and API Catalogs have become standard fare at organisations with\nambitious data plans.  Having a central directory for people to look up where to\nfind data, or which APIs exist for a requirement is key when reducing the\ntime-to-value for data & engineering teams.\n\nIn fact, without a catalog, the Data and API landscape at a large enterprise can\nquickly become overwhelming - like being lost in a new city, it’s difficult to\nknow where to look.\n\nLike a good map, a catalog is key to helping people navigate the maze of your\necosystem, and track down the data they’re trying to find.  Creating a catalog\nthat’s complete and accurate is a huge undertaking, and can be a long journey.\n\nWhen teams are assembling to start populating catalogs - it’s important they\nsight on the end-goal -- to help people find data faster.  They’re travel\nagents, not map builders - facilitating faster travel and better destinations -\nthe catalog is a means to an end.\n\nCatalogs are directions\nA well populated data catalog is key to making it easy to find the data or API\nyou need -  telling you where to find it, which system holds it, and who’s\nresponsible for it.\n\nThese instructions are like directions from a street map - a collection of\nsteps, based on metadata that has been gathered.\n\nIn the world of maps, the Google Maps navigation experience is incredible - no\nmatter your location and your destination - Google will find you a way.  Routes\nare constantly updated based on road closures and traffic.  If conditions change\nwhilst I’m enroute, Google notifies me, and updates my path.\n\nIf our data catalogs are to be the Google Maps of our data ecosystem, the user\nexperience needs to be on par.  Otherwise, they quickly get out of date - and\ninevitably you’ve taken a wrong turn.  It can be tempting to marry the roll out\nof a catalog with large scale data collection exercise, and a series of rules\nand procedures teams must follow to update the catalog with any changes.\n\nHowever, when you’re laying the foundation of your catalog creation, it’s\nimportant to ask - are you building a team of surveyors, or phenomenal\nnavigation experience?\n\nSurveyors are responsible for visiting each road, and mapping it out - it’s\narduous and time consuming work.  Google Maps leaves this to the authorities,\nand simply consumes their map data, to deliver the best navigation experience.\n For Google Maps, their business is about getting you where you need to go,\nrather than deploying an army of surveyors.\n\nBe a knowledge hub, not a local surveyancing office\nPhoto by Valeria Fursa\n[https://unsplash.com/@lerafursa?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nBack in the enterprise data world, all too often we see teams with desires of a\n Google Map view of their data ecosystem, but then fall into the trap of\nbuilding a centralized surveyancing team - rather than a decentralized metadata\ngathering function.  Before you know it, a flurry of local-council-esque\nprocesses and bylaws have been published mandating steps teams must comply with\nto evolve the data ecosystem -\n\nIf we’re to learn anything from the google model, it’s that decentralizing the\nmaintenance , and automating data capture is key.\n\nRather than adding a series of additional processes, it’s important to try and\nleverage the metadata and procedures teams are already following, with as\nminimal augmentation as possible\n\nRather than focussing maintenance via manded, governance teams need to ask the\nsame question Google Maps did:\n\nHow do we make it dead simple for local data owners to publish their own\nmetadata automatically, so maintenance is automated?\n\nIt’s important to remember your catalog is just a means to an end.  It’s\ncritical infrastructure, but it’s an Enabler - it’s not The Thing.\n\n> The reality is no-one really wants a map - they want the destination.  \nLikewise, no-one really wants a catalog - they want information.\nRemember when building your catalog that you're in the business of facilitating\ndestinations - not building beautiful maps.\n\nMoving from Inventory to Hub\nThe critical shift around the role of data catalogs (and the teams that manage\nthem), is from one of \"building\" to one of \"facilitating\".\n\nEarly catalog initiatives saw data stewards responsible for building and\nmaintaining a catalog of data inventory -- classic surveyor territory.  As the\nrole of the catalog has become more central and critical to the data landscape,\nthis hasn’t scaled well.\n\nInstead, catalogs & teams are now moving towards facilitating metadata capture -\nin all it’s varied formats.\n\nTurns out that most data platforms have metadata that describe their data.\nModern catalogs are leveraging this metadata to automate the catalog -\ngenerating listings and lineage data by interrogating metadata.  The interface\nbecomes less about data entry, and more about curation - shifting them from\nsurveyors to (meta)data hubs - just like in the Maps analogy.\n\nBy replacing the data entry with consumption of metadata - the task of building\nand updating the catalog has been decentralized - pushing responsibility back to\nthe platform owners.  These are arguably the best people to provide the metadata\nanyway - since platform owners are the subject-matter-experts of their own\nsystems.\n\nThis drive towards decentralized ownership and collaboration in the data space\nare key facets of the emerging Data Mesh\n[https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-gb/radar/techniques/data-mesh] trend, which\nfocuses on accessing and linking data products in-situ across the organization,\nrather than mandating moving into a data lake for consumption.\n\nOpen Source, Metadata and Catalogs\nAnother (sometimes overlooked) benefit of leveraging schema metadata to drive\ncatalogs is one of eliminating vendor lock-in.\n\nPreviously, the enterprise catalog was typically locked away in a fairly\nhigh-cost proprietary platform.  As catalogs become more critical infrastructure\nwithin data organisations, having a central component in proprietary tooling can\nbecome unpalatable.\n\nFurthermore, the shifting role of catalogs from data entry to data discovery,\nthe main source of data themselves becomes either schemas published by data\nplatforms (almost all schema languages are open source), or metadata about those\nschemas.  As the catalogs become tools for navigating this open source metadata,\niit makes less sense to capture catalog data in a proprietary platform.\n\nThere are a couple of key elements missing from the existing open source stack\nthat are needed to describe all the metadata required to power a full data\ncatalog:  (We’re not talking about the catalog itself here -

Now when you're writing a query in Vyne, you get as-you-type code\ncompletion, with intelligent suggestions.\n\nQueries in Vyne are written in TaxiQL\n[https://docs.taxilang.org/language-reference/querying-with-taxiql/] - a\nuniversal, open-source query language, which allows defining queries that can\nspan APIs, databases, and streaming sources.  That's really powerful, but it's\nalso really new.\n\nTaxiQL is somewhere between a SQL statement, and a GraphQL statement - and while\nit quickly feels familiar, there's always a learning curve with anything new.\n That's why it's so important to get code hinting right.\n\nCode hinting is available by pressing Ctrl+Space whilst writing a query.  The\nhints you get depend on where in the query you are, and what's available in your\ninfrastructure.  Let's take a look at some of the help Vyne gives you.\n\nFind vs Stream\nWhen writing queries, Vyne is able to connect to traditional \"Request /\nResponse\" data sources (like databases, RESTful APIs, etc), as well as\n\"Streaming\" data rouces - like Kafka topics.\n\nIn TaxiQL, this is defined by specifying your query as find or stream \nrespectively.\n\nWhen you're writing your query in Vyne, typing find will prompt you with data\navailable from request-response data sources, whereas typing stream will prompt\nyou with data available from streaming sources.\n\n\n\nImproving Filtering\nIn TaxiQL, filters are defined in parenthesis against the type you're searching\nagainst. Criteria are defined using Type names, rather than field names. (That's\nbecause Vyne is searching against mutliple data sources, each likely has it's\nown field name).\n\nSo, to find all the actors named \"Jimmy\", you might write:\n\nfind { Actor[]( FirstName = 'Jimmy' ) }\n\n\nThe kinds of filters you can apply depend on the data sources you have\navailable. For example, if you have a database exposing Actors, you can do rich\nsearching. However, if you have an API that exposes actors, the types of filters\nyou can apply depend on what the API has exposed.\n\nVyne's query editor understands this, so when you're writing a filter, pressing \nCtrl+Space will prompt you only with the attribute types that are valid for\ndefining a filter with.\n\n\n\nKnowing what data is discoverable\nVyne lets you enrich data from one source, by linking it with data from multiple\nother sources, and then reshaping into the form you need. These are called\n\"projections\".\n\nFor example, you might want to find all the films from the Film database, and\nthen enrich it with data from a REST API. Vyne's powerful integration engine\nlets you do this, without writing any integration code.\n\nGiven the wide world of your enterprise data, knowing what's discoverable\ndepends on your starting point.\n\nAs you type your query, Vyne is constantly scanning to see what data it can\nprovide, by stitching together all the different data sources in your\norganisation.\n\nBy pressing Ctrl+Space when defining a projection, Vyne will list all the data\nattributes available to you, ie., those that are discoverable based on the query\nso far.\n\n\n\nSeeing where data comes from\nVyne is linking data together from multiple different sources - sometimes taking\nmuliple \"hops\" between sources to serve up the data.\n\nThis means the list of attributes provided can be sourced from multiple\ndifferent data sources. Sometimes it's useful to know how Vyne will fetch data,\nas you're building your query.\n\nWhen you're writing a projection in a query, pressing Ctrl+Space twice brings up\na richer information window, which shows the actual path that will be navigated\nto fetch this attribute\n\n\n\nImproved lineage views\nIn addition to improving the hints you get while editing a query, we've also\nimproved the view of lineage available after the results have been returned.\n\nVyne 0.20 ships with a new query lineage view, that shows all the different\nsystems that were involved in executing a query, along with the number of\nresults that travelled each path.\n\n\n\nSQL & streaming sources in sequence diagrams\nWe've had long support for sequence diagrams showing execution plans. These have\nnow been enriched to show SQL queries and streaming sources invoked during a\nquery.\n\n\n\nClicking on any SQL source will drill down to show the actual SQL query issued,\nalong with how the query performed:\n\n\n\nSQL & streaming sources in cell-based-lineage\nWe've also extended our cell-based lineage to include all the details of SQL\nqueries and real-time sources (eg., Kafka).\n\nClicking on any value in the result of a query shows the lineage for that value,\nincluding SQL queries that were issued and API calls that were made, including\ninputs and parameters.\n\n\n\nSumming up\nVyne 0.20 is just around the corner.\n\nThese features are available now in our EAP builds, by using the docker tag \nvyneco/vyne:0.20.0-SNAPSHOT.\n\nThere's also a full walkthrough showing how to use some of the new query editor\nfeatures, along with slick new data source onboarding available in our latest\ntutorial\n[https://develop.docs.vyne.co/tutorials/api-db-integration/rest-db-integration/]\n.\n\nTake the latest build for a spin, and let us know your thoughts by reaching out\nin our Slack Channel\n[https://join.slack.com/t/vyne-dev/shared_invite/zt-697laanr-DHGXXak5slqsY9DqwrkzHg]\n.

Once change becomes restricted, the less likely it is to reflect the best possible representation of that data. The pursuit of backwards compatibility leads to hacks and workarounds.

Time since authored / maintained\n\nBreadth of usage\n\nWe’ve all seen examples of APIs where some fields are obscure or there’s\ncritical data in the comments field because it’s become too hard to change the\nAPI. Once we reach this tipping point of the paradox of success for an API, the\ncost to consume skyrockets.\n\nA general rule of thumb is that the more widely used an API is, the more inertia\nthere is to change that API. Once change becomes restricted, the less likely it\nis to reflect the best possible representation of that data. The pursuit of\nbackwards compatibility leads to hacks and workarounds. As a result, the data\nbecomes harder for consumers to navigate.\n\nA corollary to this is that consumers become less able to request changes to\ndata from a producer. A simple change by the producer might make the data better\nsuited to the consumers needs. Instead, the consumer needs to add complexity on\ntheir side.\n\nThe broader the usage of a data set, the more use cases a producer needs to\ncater for. A change that helps one consumer could have a detrimental effect on\nanother.\n\nDistance from original source\n\nData is being shared across and between organisations more than ever. The\ncommunication challenge this introduces is immense.\n\nThe further we take data from the original source, the more difficult it becomes\nto understand how to consume it. It’s harder to fall back to the option of\nhaving a conversation to increase your understanding.\n\nIf the data owner works at the open plan desk 2 metres from you, 3 days a week,\nat least you’ve got a shot at pinning them down and getting some answers.\n\nIt's a different situation when:\n\n * it's from company on the other side of the world, in a different timezone\n * they've munged it together from a bunch of other sources, and\n * changed it to match their own idea of what a good representation looks like\n\nGetting back the original context here becomes a lot more challenging.\n\nTime since authored / maintained\n\nLet’s not forget about all those network shares with mountains of random data\nsets in Excel files. In extreme cases, the cost to figure out what the data was\nsupposed to mean is so prohibitive that it’s easier to hit delete. Trying to\nunpick what your predecessor was thinking 10 years ago when they named all those\ncolumns with abbreviations just isn't worth it.\n\nThe same applies wherever data is being provided from. Consider an internal team\nthat manages 40 different applications. It's likely that not all are being\nworked on at any one time. Where no recent changes have been made to an\napplication, it's likely that the knowledge a consumer needs has been lost.\n\nHow can you fix this?\nThe best place to fix this problem is at source, with data producers. Any\nmeasures put in place after this rely on inefficient hacks and workarounds to\nderive what the producer already has access to.\n\n> The best place to fix this problem is at source, with data producers\n\nThe first step you can take is to attack the foundational problem. With their\nunderstanding of the domain, it's much easier for data producers to assign\nsemantic metadata to it. This saves every consumer for doing the same work\nindependently, and with much more difficultly. Building more advanced tools\nbecomes much easier once this information is machine readable.\n\nEmbedding this information within code and schemas has a lot of potential.  This\nwould be richer than your standard language primitive types like strings,\nintegers and booleans. Instead we can embed a set of semantic tags that\nrepresent the business domain. A meaningful library of tags such as ‘First name’\nor ‘Date of birth’ become the language used to represent your data.\n\n\nUsing similar strategies to embed descriptions of other aspects of the data can\nalso be useful for consumers. This has a huge advantage of being co-located with\nwhat it’s describing. When the underlying data changes, so too can the metadata.\nStoring things together that change in tandem is a common best practice in\nsoftware development and relevant here.\n\n\nThe second step involves recognizing the imbalance in incentives for producers\nand consumers of data.\n\n\nThis stems from the fact that the costs and benefits of well described data lie\nwith the consumer. Producers generally aren't held accountable for publishing\npoorly described data despite the significant knock-on costs. It's likely that\npart of the reason for this is that a low bar is set on average. The best one\ncan expect for data documentation is a docs page on Confluence or the vendor’s\nsite.\n\n\nYou would expect there to be some situations, such as for data marketplaces,\nthat we would see innovation in this area. Alas, even when there's inbuilt\neconomic incentives to make data as easy to consume as possible, little progress\nhas been made. For internal teams, under pressure to deliver features where the\ncost of consuming data isn’t high on the priority list, the challenge is\ngreater.\n\n\nWe can rebalance this by putting in place measures to reward and recognise\nproducers of well described data. Features in our data and API catalogs can\nmeasure and rank progress from data producers. Consumers can be directed to the\nbetter ones and make more informed choices. As a result, efforts by data\nproducers to make the lives of their consumers better can be recognised.\n\n\nFor leaders of data producers, they can make better decisions about where to\ninvest effort. This might allow the redirection the operational cost for poor\nand underutilised data. For critical data, focused investment can be made to\nreduce the total organisational cost.\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe build Vyne - an automated data integration platform. \n\nIt uses metadata from data sources to build integrations on the fly, eliminating\nthe need for integration code. Because there's no integration code, it can\nautomatically adapt when data is change or moving giving organisations a new\nlevel of flexibility in their data architectures.\n\nCheck it out at vyne.co [/p/f6520dec-735e-4caf-872e-14a379e5982f/vyne.co]","feature_image":"/content/images/2022/07/cost.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"60cb10f1221a581084165427","created_at":"2022-07-05T15:04:12.000Z","updated_at":"2022-07-06T12:06:52.000Z","published_at":"2022-07-06T12:06:53.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"62c55b85221a581084165b17","uuid":"1c32f3cb-419c-4e58-9637-7788cd16762a","title":"An overview of Vyne","slug":"introducing-vyne","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\" * [Introduction](#introduction)\\n * [Demo overview](#demo-overview)\\n * [Querying for data](#querying-for-data)\\n * [Adapting to breaking changes](#adapting-to-breaking-changes)\\n     * [Refactoring a service](#refactoring-a-service)\\n     * [Changing how Ids work](#changing-the-id-scheme)\\n * [Querying streaming data](#querying-streaming-data)\"}],[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<div style=\\\"width: 100%;\\n    min-width: 640px;\\n    min-height: 360px;

in that consumers get to\ndefine the data they want.  The differences are that consumers get to define the\nschema they want, inline - so if you want data expressed in a flat columnar\nstructure, or nested structure - that's up to you.\n\nThere isn't a single graph schema, so you don't end up with lots of consumers\nattached to a single fixed GraphQL schema.  And, there's no resolvers in the\nback-end to maintain either.\n\nVyne uses schemas published by data producers to work out where data is, and\nfetch from different sources, dynamically building integrations on-the-fly.\n\n\n\nIn this example, we built the following query:\n\n// Grab film data from the database\nfind { Film[] } as {\n\n    // select only the properties we're interested in\n    id : FilmId\n    title : Title\n    description: Description\n    \n    // Enrich with data from other services ...\n    // ... where can I watch this film?\n    streamingProviderName: StreamingProviderName\n    price: StreamingProviderPrice\n\n    // ... what are the reviews?\n    review: FilmReviewScore\n    reviewText: ReviewText\n}[]\n\n\nVyne automatically created multiple integrations to deliver this query:\n\n * A SQL Query to fetch film data\n * A series of REST API calls to show where we can watch the film\n * A series of REST API calls to fetch reviews\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdapting to breaking changes\nWith Vyne, because there's no integration code (no resolvers, or field mappings\nburied in a UI somewhere), when producer services change, Vyne automatically\nadapts.\n\nIn the next two videos, we'll introduce a couple of breaking changes to our\nproducer services.  Vyne's integration automatically adapts.\n\nThis means no breaking changes for consumers, and no having to co-ordinate\nchange.\n\nRefactoring a service\nFirst, we'll introduce breaking changes to one of our services - changing from a\nGET to a POST, and refactoring the request and response objects.\n\nAs the service restarts, it pushes it's updated schema data to Vyne.\n\nQuery consumers can continue unaffected, as Vyne's integration adapts\nautomatically.\n\nChanging the Id scheme\nIn this video, we're replacing our Reviews Service with a new service that uses\na different Id Schema (eg., perhaps we're now buying Review data from an\nexternal source).\n\nPreviously, we could use the FilmId we got from the database could be used.\n Now, there's an additional Id resolution step that needs to be performed.\n\nWe make this change by changing the Id type consumed in the new Reviews service.\n We'll push this as a breaking change, and re-run the query.\n\nVyne automatically adapts, detecting that the Ids are incompatible (because they\nhave different types), and calls a new service to resolve the Ids.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuerying streaming data\nFinally, let's link our data with a real-time streaming service - a New Releases\nmessage written in Protobuf to Kafka topic.\n\n\n\nThis time, we adjust the query, because we want a stream of data, triggered each\ntime a NewFilmReleaseAnnouncement message is written to our Kafka topic.\n\nstream { NewFilmReleaseAnnouncement } as {\n    announcement: NewFilmReleaseAnnouncement\n\n    id : FilmId\n    title : Title\n    description: Description\n\n    streamingProviderName: StreamingProviderName\n    price: StreamingProviderPrice\n\n    review: FilmReviewScore\n    reviewText: ReviewText\n}[]\n\n\nSummary\nVyne uses schemas (enriched with Taxi [https://taxilang.org] metadata) to\nautomatically integrate services.\n\nThis gives us rich federated data access, without any of the manual integration,\nresovlers, field mapping required by other approaches.\n\nFor consumers - this means fewer protocols to learn, fewer dependencies to\nmanage, and fewer data sources to connect to.\n\nIn this post, we saw a single query that linked data from across multiple\nsources:\n\n * A SQL Database\n * 3 RESTful Microservices\n * A Kafka topic, writing Protobuf\n\nAnd, we saw Vyne automatically adapt to breaking chagnes -

That’s what we’re trying to capture here.\n\nIn order to do that, we’ve created a language called Taxi to describe services\nand data.\n\nTaxi - a language for data\n\nTaxi [https://taxilang.org] brings some key principles to describing data - it’s\nlightweight, open source, and check-in-able. \n\nDescribing your data is difficult enough and it shouldn’t be made any more\ncomplicated by the language. We’ve designed it to be hand writable, but also to\nhave tools and plugins available to be able to generate it from other schema\nlanguages and code, providing that tight connection back to the underlying\nsystems where possible.\n\n\nIn the Voyager samples you’ll notice that we used more than just primitive types\nfor object properties. The Id of a Film isn’t just a number or string, it’s\nFilmId. That’s because we think that understanding the meaning of your data is\nextremely important. So important in fact that it should be captured in our code\nand schemas to help people understand our systems. \n\nThis is important in Voyager when we look at it from the lens of understanding\nour data as part of a wider ecosystem and not just in isolation for one system.\nThe models and property names for the same piece of data might differ between\nsystems, but using Taxi we can use a type system to express how they relate to\neach other.\n\nWhere it’s going\n\nVoyager is one component of our wider platform, Vyne [https://vyne.co], that\neliminates integration code between services. By leveraging the relationships\nbetween types, Vyne is able to automate the integration across your stack.\n\nWe think Voyager is a useful tool for engineers by itself so we’ve extracted it\nto a standalone app that we can release separately. We’re also working on\nopen-sourcing the code for it, but we’ve got some work to do on modularising our\ncode base before we can get to that.\n\nThis is also part of a broader project we’re working on to help teams with\nunderstanding the connections between their systems. For a team managing a\ncollection of systems, there’s no good repository of knowledge for collecting\nand describing how those systems interact with each, and with the wider world\nwhether that’s internal or external systems.\n\nHaving a simple method to produce a diagram is great, but we’re all about\neliminating work not just moving it. \n\nThe next step will be to provide a simple way of connecting your schemas to\nVoyager to help generate the Taxi and diagrams for you and provide that link\nback to the source code, along with a raft of UX ideas.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe’re keen to hear what you think!
